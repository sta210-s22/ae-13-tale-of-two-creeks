Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Ghandi. Spielberg was robbed. This was before he outgrew his Peter Pan syndrome.,3

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(surprised) What?!,30
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,She points to Dawson.,31

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Whoa Jo, don't hit and run. (Joey turns around) C'mon, explain yourself.",39
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,I just think our emerging hormones are destined to alter our relationship and I'm trying to limit the fallout.,40
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"Dawson gets up off the bed with his arms crossed, smiling.",41
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Your emerging hormones aren't developing a thang for me, are they?",42
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,A thing?,43
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Touches her forehead sarcastically like she has to think about it.,44
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"No, I'm not getting a thing for you Dawson. I've known you too long. I've seen you burp, barf, pick your nose, scratch your butt. I don't think I'm getting a thing for you.",45
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,So what's the problem?,46
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,We're changing and we have to adjust or else the male/female thing will get in the way.,47
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Dawson sits back down on the bed.,48
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"What's with this When Harry met 80's crap. It doesn't apply to us, we transcend it.",49
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,And how do we do that?,50
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(lying back) By going to sleep. I'm tired.,51
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,That's avoidance.,52
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"No, it's proof. Proof that we can still remain friends, despite any mounting sexual theoretics.",53
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(pauses for a minute) I don't think it works that way Dawson.,54
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Come on, don't get female on me Joey. I don't want to have to start calling you Josephine.",55
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(smiling) Josephine this!,56
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,She leaps onto the bed and attacks him with punches. They tickle and punch each other until Dawson has the upper hand.,57
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"(noticing Dawson's body slightly on top of hers) Okay, I give...I give.",58
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"We're friends okay? (Joey nods, smiling) No matter how much body hair we acquire? Deal?",59

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(snuggling into pillow) Goodnight Dawson.,68
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"Joey shifts farther away from Dawson. Dawson looks over, noticing. He moves a little to his side of the bed and glances over again, as she scoots closer to the edge. Dawson pauses, staring up at the ceiling.",69
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Why'd you have to bring this up anyway?,70
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Opening Credits. Paula Cole's ""I Don't Want to Wait"" plays.",71
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Sail boats drift along a lake on a sunny day. Pan from boats to dock, where Joey is sitting in a lawn chair. The camera moves closer as tense music plays. Suddenly something rises from the lake and grabs her.",72
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Ahhhhhhhh!!,73
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,The thing takes her and the lawn chair crashing into the water. Cut to Dawson with his video camera on a hand-made moving crane.,74
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"No! Cut, cut, cut. Pacey...three counts you gotta wait before you come up, come on!",75
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,We realize it's Pacey cloaked in a sea creature costume. He tries to climb up on the dock but Joey grabs him and pulls him back down.,76
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"(climbing up) God, Pacey!",77
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Pacey takes off his sea creature mask and follows her up.,78
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,What was that all about?,79
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"(watching, and commenting the whole time) Joey...(pause) Pacey, C'mon. You go before she's established on the dock, it's not scary.",80
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Joey grabs a towel and wraps it around her neck.,81
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"You did it again, you grabbed my ass.",82
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,(waving it off) Like you even have one.,83
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Guys, were way behind schedule, all right. We got two weeks, I'm not going to make the festival.",84
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,I'm not playing the victim.,85
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Hello, some cooperation.",86
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"Hey, it's Meryl Streep's fault okay, I'm doing my best.",87
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(glaring at him) Bite me.,88
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Dawson notices a yellow taxi pull up next door. A beautiful blond girl steps out and looks around. Pacey glances over and sees the taxi also. Joey is to busy glaring at Pacey to notice.,89
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"Well, my mouth drops.",90
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"Pacey starts down the dock toward the girl. Dawson pauses, then follows. Joey watches and trails behind them. Cut to the girl walking toward them.",91

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,That's right,101
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Wow, you look...different.",102

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"So, Jen are you just visiting?",104
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Oh yeah, my grandfather's aorta collapsed and they had to replace it with this plastic tube, so my parents sent me to help for a while.",105

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(laughing) We just met!,120
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,They climb the porch steps.,121
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"And a wasted moment it was. I mean greater men would be nailing right now, you know what I mean?",122
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"(opening front door) Tact, look it up.",123
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"They walk into the house to be confronted with the sound of glass breaking. Worried, they walk quickly through the house and into the living room. They see Dawson's parents kissing passionately on a broken coffee table, their clothes in disarray.",124

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,They break their kiss.,126

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,They kiss.,142
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Mom...ah!,143
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"The creek. Dogs bark in the background. Joey rows her boat up to their dock and ties it up. She gets out and waltzes up to the house. She's intercepted by her sister's boyfriend, Bodie. He walks towards her with a pot and an apron tied around his waist.",144
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bodie,Just the victim I'm looking for.,145
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"(smiling) No, Bodie. Not again.",146
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bodie,But I'm being tested on this one. Here have a taste.,147
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bodie,He gives her a spoonful.,148
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(pauses) Orgasmic. Where's Bess?,149
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Joey's pregnant older sister comes out the front door carrying a shirt.,150
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bess,"If you want to wear my things, fine. They're fairly useless to me now. But that means you put them back...where you found them. Got it?",151
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(with attitude) Got it.,152
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bess,I am way too pregnant to be digging underneath your bed.,153
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"(even more attitude) So stay out of my room, got it?",154
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,She walks away. Bess turns toward Bodie.,155
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bess,"I'm going to knock her silly, I swear it.",156
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bodie,"Here, taste this.",157
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bodie,"He gives her a sample. She's doubtful at first. That changes, as she tastes it.",158
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bess,(closing her eyes) Mmmm...Orgasmic.,159
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bodie,(giving her a kiss) Awww...,160

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(taking videos from man) Thank you.,162
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,The customer leaves as Pacey walks in from the back of the store.,163
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"So, if your dad's Mr. Man-meat, does that make you Mr. Man-meat Jr. or Mr. Man-meat the second?",164
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"They're going to have to drag the creek to find your body, Pacey.",165

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,Nellie whips around.,173
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Nellie,"I'm sorry what did you say? Did you toss a negative, disparaging remark my way? Because if you did, and correct me if I'm wrong, I'd like to remind you who you are.",174
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"I know, I know. Your dad owns the place.",175
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Nellie,"Nooo, I'm talking about in the huge, rotating world of life.",176

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,Dawson heads toward the back.,178
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Nellie,"Nobody. That's the point. You're not there, you don't even exist. Because if you did, I might have to respond to your pathetic little under the breath one-liners. But instead I take comfort knowing your vapor. Phooo, Phoooo!",179
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Nellie,"She waves her arms around in the air and heads to the back room, where Dawson emerges from, smiling.",180
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Nellie,"Non-existent, nothing.",181
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Nellie,An attractive older woman in a very short dress walks through the door. The boys stare at her as she approaches them.,182
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"Oh my God, look at her!",183

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Well, he's breathing. Good sign.",226
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Dawson laughs.,227

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Are you familiar with obsessive reality disorder?,247
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"It's beyond that. See I believe that all of the mysteries of the Universe, all of life's questions, can be found in a Spielberg movie.

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Jen's Grandparent's house. Jen walks into her grandfather's room where he's sleeping. She looks both ways in the hall before sitting down.,274
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Good morning Granddad.,275
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"She looks at his scar, visible under his pajamas. She touches it lightly.",276
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,(walking in) What are you doing?,277
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Oh, Oh I was just saying good morning.",278
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,Your breakfast is ready.,279
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Oh (pause) I'm glad to be here Grams.,280
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,Don't wanna be late your first day.,281
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,She walks out of the room leaving Jen holding her Grandfather's hand.,282
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,Close up on a pan of scrambled eggs being stirred. Pull back to reveal Jen at the breakfast table.,283
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,You know I don't usually eat in the morning Grams. I mean I appreciate the thought and all but my eyes are barely propped open by noon. Just a coffee fix and I'm set.,284
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,She pours herself a cup.,285
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,(setting a plate in front of her) Well I'll remember that in the future.,286
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,(holding the mug) So tell me about this Dawson guy next door. He looks so different. He used to be kinda short and compact.,287
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,"You stay away, that boy is trouble.",288
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Aren't they all? (pauses) Well, what about the girl who lives down the creek...Joey I think her name is?",289
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,"(sitting down) That girl from down the creek has been crawling into the window of that boy next door for the past ten years. Neither goes to church, I believe they're what you call the wrong element.",290
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,(sipping her coffee) Right.,291
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Grams lowers her head to say prayers. Jen sets her coffee down and lays her napkin in her lap. Grams looks at her out of the corner of her eye.,292
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,Say grace dear.,293
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"That's okay, you do it.",294
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,It would be nice if you did it.,295
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,I don't think so Grams. Thanks for the offer.,296
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,Is their some reason you don't want to thank our Lord this morning?,297
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"You know Grams, I really didn't want to get into this, you know. Kinda causes a headache but um, (pauses) I don't really do well with church and the Bible and this prayer stuff.",298
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,Beg your pardon?,299
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"I don't covet a religious God, Grams. I'm an Atheist.",300
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Camera lingers on Grams shocked expression. ""Tubthumping"" by Chumbawumba plays.",301
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Flash scenes of Capeside High School. Kids getting off their bus, tossing footballs and Frisbees. Cut to school hall. Pan down to Jen, at her locker, putting things in her backpack. She holds her schedule in her teeth while trying to fit things in. Nellie walks up.",302
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Nellie,"(smiling) Hi, I'm Nellie Olsen.",303
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,(removing schedule from her mouth) Nellie as in Little House...,304
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Nellie,"I know, I know. Little House on the Prairie, it was like my mom and dad's favorite show. But no preconceptions okay? I'm not like her at all.",305
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Uh, I'm Jen.",306
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Nellie,"From New York. I know. How's your grandfather? He has us all worried. He's still on the prayer list at church, you party?",307
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Excuse me?,308
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Nellie,Par-ty?,309
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Uh, party as in do I like to have a good time, or party as in drink and use drugs?",310
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Nellie,It's objective.,311
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,I like to have a good time. Substance free.,312
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Nellie,Maybe we should call you Nellie. (shrugs) See ya!,313
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Nellie,"She walks away. Jen turns, a little dazed, back to her locker.",314
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(walking up) Hey! How's it going?,315
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,I could really use a cigarette.,316
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(surprised) You smoke?,317
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Uh, I quit. I'm just a little tense.",318
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(smiling) Well you're hiding it well.,319
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,I have a great denial system.,320
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Yeah, it's the first day, we're all a little tense. It'll get easier.",321
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Good.,322
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,How's your schedule? They screwed up mine.,323
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Jen brings her schedule out and they look it over.,324

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Um...Briston. Biology.,326
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,I was just heading that way.,327
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,(Smiling) Were you?,328
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"She closes her locker and they walk off down the hall. ""Tubthumping"" plays.",329
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Cut to Pacey in a classroom. He balances a book on his head as other student enter, talking and take their seats. The door opens and Tamara enters. Pacey turns in time to see her, surprised. He grabs the book from off his head.",330

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,(pushing pause on the remote) You know the film?,339
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Universal, 1960. Little known fact: Did you know that Hitchcock surprised Janet Leigh with freezing cold water in order to get her to scream so effectively?",340
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,Who are you?,341
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Dawson Leery.,342
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,Then I take it you'll be in my fifth period film lab.,343
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Actually that's why I'm here. (he pulls his schedule out from backpack) There seems to have been some confusion with my schedule. I was denied admittance to your film class.,344
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,Then you must be a sophomore.,345
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(pausing) And that's not a good thing?,346
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,"It's a very popular class Dawson. Seating is limited. Theirs a waiting list, priority goes to upperclassmen.",347
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Well that's stupid.,348
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,Excuse me?,349
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Who made that rule?,350
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,I did.,351
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Oh.,352
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,Why are you so adamant?,353
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"(smiling) Passion, Mr. Gold. Pure, mad-driven passion. Movies are my life.",354
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,(getting up to sit at desk) Oh I see.,355
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,I'm sorry. I'm not coming across well at all here. The point is I'm going to be a filmmaker. It's my life's ambition. It always has been. How many students do you have in this class that can say that?,356
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Cut to Mr. Gold's face.,357
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(continuing) This is a small town Mr. Gold. Theirs not a lot of opportunity for me. You have the power. You could easily override this bizarre rule that denies students their education.,358
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,Your very convincing Dawson Leery. But I'm afraid the class is maxed out. I wish I could make case by case exceptions but that would be unfair and problematic. I'm sorry to say that no is my definitive answer.,359
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,But...,360
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,"No, Period. It's a complete sentence.",361
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,Cut to Dawson's face. A bell rings. Joey and Jen walk out of Biology into the already crowded hall.,362
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Hey Joey. Um, can I ask you something kinda up front?",363
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Sure.,364
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Are you and Dawson (laughs nervously) a thing?,365
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"(shrugging it off) No, were just friends.",366
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Like were going to be, I hope. (pause) You know, my Grams warned me about you. She said you're severely troubled.",367
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"Well, no offense but your Gram's is cracked.",368
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Why does she rag on you?,369
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"Pick a topic. There's my dad, the imprisoned convict or my sister impregnated by her black boyfriend.",370
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Your father's in prison?,371
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(kinda proudly) Conspiracy to traffic marijuana in excess of ten thousand pounds.,372

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"(looking away) Oh, she had this cancer thing. It got her.",374
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,So then you live with your sister?,375
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"And the black boyfriend. (pause) He likes you, you know.",376
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,(confused) Who the black boyfriend?,377
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(interrupting) Dawson. Don't abuse his feelings.,378
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Joey walks away. Jen stares after her and sighs.,379
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"Capeside cafeteria. A balding, overweight man walks past Dawson, Jen and Joey at a lunch table.",380

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Pled justifiable homicide. They didn't have a hall pass.,382
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,The two laugh. Joey watches them.,383
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Woman in funky black dress. Periodic drinker. Blacks out after two glasses of cheap whine and runs through town with her dress over her head.,384
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Singing Neil Diamond songs.,385
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,They share another laugh. Joey is disgusted.,386
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,You're good. I should bring you in to touch up my dialogue.,387
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"(handing him her script) Um, we're supposed to be working Dawson.",388
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,He takes it from her.,389
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Yeah, um would you mind taking a look at Act Three. I'm having a climax issue.",390
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,(picking it up) Sure.,391
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Joey sets her hand in her chin and rolls her eyes.,392
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Cut to Tamara eating lunch at her desk. Pacey walks in with his backpack.,393

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,Just as I remembered.,395
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,Are you looking for romance tonight?,396
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,"(smiling) Why, you got any suggestions?",397
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"Uh, have you ever seen The Summer of '42?",398
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,(leaning back in her chair) Refresh my memory.,399
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"Well, it's about a beautiful woman who seduces a young boy on the verge of manhood.",400
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,It's a favorite.,401
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"I, uh, could reserve it for you if you like?",402
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,"Actually, tonight I'm going to see that new film playing at The Realto.",403
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,Students start to enter and take their seats. Pacey looks disappointed.,404
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,Yeah.,405
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,It's getting great reviews.,406
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,(brightening) Uh yeah. I guess I'll maybe check it out then.,407
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,He walks backwards into a student.,408
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Boy,"Hey, watch it!",409
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Boy,"Pacey waves goodbye and heads out. Tamara watches him, thoughtful. A bell rings.",410

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Dude, negative.",413
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,What?! I actually have the possibility of losing my virginity in a high level fantasy fashion.,414
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"(stopping at a water fountain) Pacey, go home. Walk your dog. It's not going to happen.",415
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"Not tonight! That's not the plan, man. I just want to familiarize her with the gaze, the smile, the charming features, you know.",416
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Don't do this to yourself!,417
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"Look, it is a fact that a large percentage of older women are attracted to young boys on the verge of manhood. It keeps them feeling young. I read that in Cosmopolitan.",418
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,What are you doing reading Cosmopolitan?,419
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"Look, I have three menstrually diverse sisters, Cosmo is my savior.",420
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(laughing) What do you need me for?,421
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"Moral support. Okay, It'll be cool. You can invite Ms. Teen New York.",422
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,He looks down the hall as he talks and sees Jen conversing with a boy in a letterman's jacket. Dawson notices also.,423
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,(talking to the boy) That sounds good.,424
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"Unless somebody's beaten you to it. C'mon man, get in there. Be assertive. Talk to her alright? You should be the one reading Cosmo. It'll build your female esteem. (pushes him) Go on...",425
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,Dawson punches him jokingly and walks down the hall towards Jen. He looks back as he passes the boy and reached Jen.,426
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Dawson, hey, how's it going?",427
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Pretty good. I see you've met Roger Fullford.,428

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Hey, uh Pacey and his crew's directing a trip to the movies tonight, nothing big, just a few of us. Would you like to come?",436

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(dead panning) I'd rather go down in a plane crash.,443
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"C'mon it's going to really, really weird with just two guys and Jen. It'll even it out.",444
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"So, would it be like a double date?",445
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Sorta, but not really. Pacey's on this hormonal mission...",446
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(interrupting) Are you having an aneurysm? No way!,447
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,It's not like a date-date. It's just so that Jen won't feel uncomfortable.,448
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,We wouldn't want that.,449
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"C'mon, Joey please? Please, please, please, please, please! (he stops and grabs her arm) C'mon, Joey please?!",450
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(giving in) Whatever.,451

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"(walking into kitchen) Well Dawson has a g*n, I thought we'd go knock off a liquor store, then go get tattoos.",456
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,Why do you talk like that?,457
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,I'm simply trying to establish a rapport with you that's based on humor. I'm completely harmless. You'll see.,458
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,Well be back by ten.,459
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,(surprised) I can do that. Thanks for being so cool about this. I thought you were going to chain me up to a chair or something.,460
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,"Not at all, you want to go to the movies, go. Have fun, just as long as you come to church with me on Sunday.",461
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"I knew there was going to be catch. Grams, I'm sorry but I'm afraid you're going to have to give up on this one.",462

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,I know what happened in New York. Church will do you good.,465
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Let me determine that. Church isn't the answer, not for me. But I promise to you that I'll keep an open mind and honor and respect your beliefs for as long as I'm here.",466
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,"The decision has been made. You will do what I say, you are under my guard.",467
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"(hands on hips) Ah, you know I am trying really hard to keep my rebellious nature in check. (pauses to think) I'll tell you what Grams. I'll go to church when you say the word pen1s.",468
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Grams,(startled) You stop that talk!,469
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,It's just a word Grams. Clinical and technical. pen1s.,470
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Pause on Grams flustered expression. Jen goes over to her and gives her a hug.,471

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Leery,What do you think (he holds up miniature plastic doll) I thought all the waitresses could wear scuba gear.,475
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"(massages neck) Completely impractical. Dad, this whole aquatic- themed restaurant idea gets worse on a daily basis.",476

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"What is up with the s*x?! That's all anybody thinks of anymore. s*x, s*x, s*x!! I mean, what is the big deal?",484
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Leery,s*x is a very big part of who we are as human beings.,485
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Does that mean we have to go hump the coffee table? (pauses) If s*x is so important then how come Spielberg never has had a s*x scene in one of his movies, hmm? He keeps it in it's proper place in film as should we in life.",486
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Doorbell rings.,487
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,I'll be home early.,488

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bess,(takes her face in her hands) Your attitude has got to go.,493
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bess,She uncaps a lipstick with her teeth and starts to apply it on her. Joey tries to pull away then gives in. Bodie watches and smiles.,494

Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bess,Joey does so.,496
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bess,You hold onto this and every half hour to an hour you excuse yourself to go touch up. Got it?,497
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Bess,"She hands her the lipstick. Joey turns to leave, then twists back around and smiles. She runs down to the dock. Cut to a fading sunset, then the foursome walking along a sidewalk to the movies.",498
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,So do you plan on staying the whole school year?,499
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Well, that depends on my Grams really, and my mom and dad.",500

Pan to Dawson's hand. It starts to reach for Jen's then pulls back. Joey becomes aware of his motions. Dawson taps his hand against his leg then goes for her hand again. It lightly brushes against Jen's, who takes notice. He finally makes his move, and takes her hand in his.",517
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"(sitting up) So, Jen are you a size queen?",518
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Excuse me?,519
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Well how important is the size to you?,520
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Joey!,521
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,She lifts her eyebrows at him and listens to Jen.,522
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Well being a virgin, I guess I haven't really given it that much though, how about yourself Jo?",523
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(debating) I'm torn...,524
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"(grabbing her and pulling her out of her seat) You and me, outside now. I'm going to k*ll you. I'm going to k*ll you!",525
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,What do you think Dawson? (to Jen) Notice the long fingers?,526
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Pan over to Pacey sitting down next to Tamara.,527
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,Hey Tamara.,528
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"She turns smiling, until she realizes it's Pacey.",529
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,Hi...Pacey what are you doing here?,530
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,Just checking out the movie. I came with some friends.,531
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,"(looking back to where he's pointing.) Oh good, I'm glad.",532
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"But I can sit here with you, you know. Wanna Milk Dud?",533
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,No.,534
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"By the way, The Summer of '42 is officially reserved in your name.",535
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,"Oh Pacey, look, I don't think you understand...",536
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"No, no, no. It was nothing. I could even come over. We could watch it together.",537
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"A man with popcorn approaches the two and goes to sit down, only to find Pacey in his seat.",538
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,"Hi, uh Pacey are you sure you don't wanna go sit with your friends?",539
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,(arrogant) Whose this guy?,540
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,A friend.,541
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Guy sitting behind them,"Hey, quiet!",542
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,Sorry.,543
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,"Tammy, is this kid bothering you?",544
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,No Benji.,545
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,(snickering) Benji? Ms. Jacobs invited me herself.,546
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,"Not exactly. Look Pacey you have got to understand, I was only renting a movie.",547
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,Pacey looks confused.,548
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,"Look, why don't I help you find your seat.",549
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,"Pacey gets up quickly and pushes Benji. The popcorn spills all over the guy behind them, who punches Pacey in the face.",550
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Mr. Gold,Cut to the lobby of the movie theater.,551
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Are you twiggy? What is your problem?,552
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,My problem is that from the moment Little Miss Highlights showed up you haven't said one word to me!,553
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Crap! That is pure crap and you know it!,554
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,All I know is that all your blood is rushing down and you can't even acknowledge another human being's even present.,555
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"I like her okay! Sue me, I thought you were my friend. Where is a little understanding?",556
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,I understand. I'm tired of understanding. All I do is understand!,557
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,She goes to leave.,558
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Joey!,559
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,She turns back.,560
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Nothing penetrates with you Dawson Your so far removed from reality you can't even see what's right in front of you.,561
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,What are you talking about?,562
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Your life. It's a freaking fairy tale and you don't even know it. (she approaches him) You just want *conflict* for that script of yours. (pause) Stop living in the movies. (pauses again) Grow up.,563
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,She leaves. Close up on Dawson's upset face.,564
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,Dawson and Jen walking through Jen's yard.,565
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,I'll walk you to your door.,566
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Not with Grams waiting to pounce.,567
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Oh, that's right.",568
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,yeah.,569
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,They reach the fence.,570
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,So...,571
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,So...,572
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,It was a really repulsive evening.,573
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Jen laughs. Dawson moves in to kiss her. Jen pauses, then pulls back.",574
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Uh, you know what? This is all my fault. I mean, I know I don't posses much power in the universe but I feel completely responsible for tonight Dawson.",575
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"(interrupting) No, uh... I pulled the pin, I tossed the grenade. I got a big old L right (makes a loser sign on his forehead)...",576
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"No, your not a loser Dawson. Your very sweet. Smart, you got a great sense of humor. Your cool with out being really obnoxious about it. Your very, very talented. (pause) You got clear skin, big plus.",577
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,They laugh.,578
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(smiling) Thank you.,579
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,No. Thank you Dawson. Things weren't so great for me in New York and their kinda scary right now so...thank you.,580
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,Grams shows up at the door.,581
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Oh, um...I should go. But thanks for everything Dawson.",582
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,but...,583
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Jen walks up her steps and turns around.,584
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,I'm just going to pretend we kissed okay?,585
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Dawson laughs and watches her go up to the house. He stares after her, with a smile, thinking.",586
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Jen,"Cut to Pacey walking along the boardwalk with a swollen eye. He spots Tamara, and stops, shaking his head.",587
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,(to himself) What are the chances?,588
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,He walks up to her.,589
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,"(noticing him) Pacey, are you okay?",590
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,I'll live.,591
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,"Wait, talk to me a second.",592
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,"She tries to touch his face, but he pushes her away.",593
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"About what, The Graduate or The Summer of '42, which would you rather discuss?",594
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,I'd like to clear up this misunderstanding.,595
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,I understand you perfectly well *Ms.* Jacobs.,596
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,I'm so sorry.,597
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,Well you should be because you're a liar. How can you say you were just renting a movie?,598
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,Because it's the truth.,599
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"It's a crock. The truth is you're a well put together, knock out of a woman who's feeling a little insecure about hitting forty. So when a young, virile boy, such as myself flirts with you, you enjoy it. You entice it. You fantasize about what it would be like to be with that young boy on the verge of manhood. Cause it helps you stay feeling attractive. Makes the aging process a little more bearable. Well, let me tell you something. You blew it lady, because I'm the best s*x you'll never have.",600
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"She stares at him, almost in awe.",601
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,Your wrong about one thing Pacey. Your not a boy.,602
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,"She wraps her arms around him and they kiss passionately. The kiss goes on, until she finally pulls away, shocked at what had happened.",603
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,I'm sorry. Oh God.,604
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Tamara,She runs away as Pacey looks on.,605
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"(amused) I'll see you in school, Ms. Jacobs.",606
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Pacey,"Cut to Dawson's house. Dawson enters his room and switches the TV on. He grabs some stuff off his bed and opens the closet door to be startled by Joey, who sits there.",607
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"Oh, what are you doing in there?",608
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(softly) Hanging with the clothes.,609
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"She gets up and flops on the bed, a stuffed ET doll in hand.",610
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,What happened tonight Joey?,611
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,I wigged out.,612
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,What is going on between us?,613
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,I have no idea.,614
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,I know I have this incredibly perfect life and I completely under- appreciate it.,615
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"(looking up) Yeah, you do.",616
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,I'm sorry I was such an insensitive male. I thought I was above it. (pause) I don't wanna lose you Joey. What we have is the *only* thing that makes sense to me.,617
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,He sits in chair.,618
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"When I saw you in the movie theater with that lipstick on, I remember thinking how pretty you looked. (Joey looks at him) I mean, I ignored it. But I thought it.",619
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(smiling disbelievingly) Yeah?,620
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,But that was it Jo. (her smile fades) It didn't go any further than that.,621
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,(sitting up) When I saw you going for Jen's hand...It's not like I wanted to be the one holding your hand. (Dawson nods) I just didn't want her holding it.,622
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,So where does that leave us?,623
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Joey just sighs.,624
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(exasperated) It's all so complicated!,625
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"Were growing up Dawson, that's all. I mean even Spielberg outgrew his Peter Pan syndrome. (she stands up)",626
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(notices her leaving) Where are you going?,627
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"I can't sleep over anymore. And we can't talk to each other like we used to, there's just some things we *can't* say.",628
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"No that's just not true, Joey I can you tell you anything.",629
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"Yeah? How often do you walk your dog, huh?",630
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,What?!,631
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"You know what I mean. What time of day, how many times a week?",632
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,"Dawson looks away, uncomfortable. Joey watches as his embarrassment grows. Her face falls.",633
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(softly) Goodnight.,634
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,Joey pauses then turns for the window. She looks back once.,635
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Joey,See ya Dawson.,636
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(almost to himself) See ya Joey.,637
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"[She leaves. Dawson, angry at himself, gets up and sighs in frustration. Joey hurries down the ladder. Dawson runs his hands through his hair, distraught. Cut to Joey walking fast, arms crossed, tears beginning to flow. Dawson bangs his head against his closet. Cut to Joey running, the tears flowing faster, to the dock. Dawson sits in his chair, looking at his picture of Steven Spielberg, thinking. Joey unties the boat as quickly as she can. The camera closes in on her face.]",638
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(off camera) Joey!,639
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"She looks up, her face streaked with tears.",640
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,(at window) Usually in the morning with Katie Couric.,641
Dawson's Creek,1,0,Dawson,"[Cut to Joey's confused face. She stares at him, mystified. Suddenly she realizes and breaks out in a grin. Laughing she pulls the boat away. Cut back and forth between the two, smiling and laughing. Joey rows away, happy. A car door slams. She looks and sees Mrs. Leery leaning into her co-anchor Bob's car and kissing him. Joey stares in shock. She glances up at Dawson's window to see if he noticed. The window's empty. The camera fades on Joey's stunned expression.]",642
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"I know what I saw. It was big and it was ugly and it attacked me and it's still out there, just waiting.",643
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Pacey takes hold of Joey's shoulders.,644
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"I might not believe you Stephanie, (he touches her hair) but I believe in you.",645
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"He moves in to kiss her. He gets closer until just as their lips would meet, Joey pulls away.",646
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(disgusted) Uh...,647
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"(turning to camera, frustrated) What? What?! Come on, What?",648
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(off screen) Cut!,649
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Sorry Dawson but he is just too repelling.,650
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"(off screen) Joey, You're going to have to kiss him.",651
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"The camera pulls back from TV, where the movie was playing, and quick pans over to Dawson painting a model of Joey's head.",652
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(turning off TV with remote) I cannot and will not kiss that cretin.,653
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"It's a movie, you're playing a character. It's not Pacey your kissing.",654
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"So he's a sea serpent from the deep, cite the difference?",655
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"But your not aware of his evil alter ego, you're in love.",656
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(sets remote on bed) Forget it.,657
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"The movie doesn't work without a kiss Joey, it's a love story.",658
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,It's a horror movie Dawson!,659
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,It's an homage with a heavy allegorical slant.,660
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Joey (flops back on bed) But he's so... unkissworthy.,661
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(looks at her) Do it for me?,662
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(leaning up on her elbows) I don't want to regurgitate on camera. Why don't you kiss him?,663
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Because *my* lips are reserved for someone else.,664
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(sits up) Have you kissed little miss someone else yet?,665
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,There's no need to rush fate.,666
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Don't wait an eternity Dawson, I mean she's from New York where things tend to move faster.",667
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"But, well then how enchanting to meet a strapping young man who doesn't have s*x on the brain.",668
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(leans back again) If it helps you sleep at night.,669
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Joey, you heard her yourself. Through her own admittance, she's a self-proclaimed virgin.",670
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,For another second!,671
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Jen happens to be a bright, intelligent young woman who clearly is in charge of her own body.",672
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"I'm not suggesting leather straps and Crisco, just a kiss!",673
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Oh Jen and I will definitely kiss, don't you worry. The question is will your lips ever find Pacey's?",674
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,I vote for an extensive re-write.,675
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"(smiling) Well that's to bad, because *you* definitely have kissing lips.",676
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(confused) What?,677
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"(turning model of her head for her to see) Check that out. You give good lip. (pause) You know,",678
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Joey you could always just close your eyes and think of someone else.,679
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Joey sighs and lays down again, discreetly sneaking a peek at Dawson out of the corner of her eye.",680
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(thinking) Explain to me the Crisco?,681
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Joey smiles.,682
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Opening Credits. Dawson's Creek theme song plays.,683
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,~~~~~~~~~~Part One~~~~~~~~~~,684
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Shots of the exterior of Capeside High School. Cut to a hand picking up a microphone. Pan up to Nellie, who removes a piece of gum from her mouth and starts the morning announcement.",685
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Nellie,(seriously) *Don't* forget about the big dance on Saturday to celebrate our victory at the big game on Friday.,686
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Nellie,Cut to the hallways of Capeside as students get ready to go to class.,687
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Nellie,(over the intercom) Even if we don't know yet if we'll even win the big game but the planning committee is *really* optimistic. Get your tickets now!,688
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Nellie,Mr. Gold's room. Dawson opens the door and enters.,689
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Mr. Gold, got a sec?",690
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Gold,(sits on table) What is it Dawson?,691
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Gold,Dawson takes a seat at the table across from him.,692
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Um, well I've been thinking about what you said and... you were right to not let me into your class.",693
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Gold,(taking off glasses) I'm glad you gave it some thought.,694
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"I did. I am, however, in a bit of a jam. See I have study hall in the library fifth period and it's really overcrowded in there, major overflow. It's sweaty, unpleasant... and I talked to Mr. Gibbons about switching study halls and he seemed to think that with your permission I could just spend study hall with you.",695
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Gold,"Hmm, fifth period?",696
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Gold,"Dawson nods, pretending to be clueless.",697
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Gold,That's exactly when film class is.,698
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(breaking out in a grin) Now that's an uncanny coincidence.,699
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Mr. Gold (pauses) You will not be part of the class, you will sit in the back and be quiet. You will not participate or involve yourself in anyway.",700
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"(interrupting) Great, great! Thank you Mr. Gold, thank you. I, I really... (pause) This is a big deal.",701
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Cut to Pacey sitting in Tamara's chair at her school desk. She walks in briskly but slows down when she sees Pacey.,702
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,(getting up) Good morning Ms. Jacobs.,703
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,Good morning Pacey.,704
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,Can we talk?,705
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,Ah... you know this isn't your class so I'll see you later.,706
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"(amused) No, we *really* need to talk.",707
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"Well we have nothing to discuss, except homework which there's none so you can just run along.",708
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,There's a lot to discuss. We could start with the open mouth kiss if you like.,709
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,I don't know what your talking about... and I'm going to have to insist that you leave!,710
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,I'm just as confused as you are.,711
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,Students enter and begin to take their seats. A few stare at Pacey and Ms. Jacobs.,712
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,(whispering) Pacey please! Nothing happened. There was no kiss. Please don't.,713
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,(under his breath to her) Your tongue was in my mouth. (pause) You're not being fair.,714
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,He leaves the classroom. Tamara composes herself and tries to smile at her students.,715
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,Good morning everyone.,716
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"Lunchroom. Dawson pulls up a chair at a table already seating Joey, Jen and Pacey.",717
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Okay, I'm not going to be able to count on the film class for support like I was hoping. Which means, we're going to have to work overtime if we want to make the festival deadline. We have to sh**t all weekend. Joey, this means, no lip about giving Pacey lip.",718
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,I'm reaching a breaking point with this whole kiss thing.,719
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"I'm not engorged with this, either okay? It goes both ways.",720
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"(thinking) Joey, major revelation. All right, I think I know a way to make you the happiest actress in the world. You know how you die in the end of the movie? How would you like to die sooner?",721
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Like tomorrow?,722
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(puzzled) What do you mean?,723
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Okay, your character in a surprise attack is k*lled violently but you're beautiful but bright cousin from New York arrives just in time to find your mutilated body.",724
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"You know, dude. I think you're on to something here.",725
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,Wait. If that means I'm going to be playing...,726
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"(interrupting) No, no, no it's perfect! This nullifies the kiss issue (looking at Joey) and puts *you* back behind the camera with *me* where you belong.",727
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Joey smiles.,728
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Well, but... I mean haven't you already shot a lot of stuff with Joey's character?",729
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"It's an easy cover. Oh, it's better this way, it's so unpredictable! The audience is never gonna see it coming! It's like Janet Leigh in Psycho.",730
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,Drew Barrymore in Scream.,731
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(looking at Pacey) Ah, rip-off of a rip-off.",732
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"You know I really think it fits in right in mind with the whole tone of the piece, don't you think?",733
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(smiling, sneaking a look at Jen) You're right, Dawson. It's perfect.",734
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Cut to Ms. Jacobs's class. The class is discussing Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights.,735
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"Okay, someone explain to me the state of Catherine's mind as she drove Heathcliff away.",736
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,Nellie raises her hand eagerly.,737
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Nellie,It was her tragic and dysfunctional way of letting him know she loved him.,738
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"Yes that's the oblivious interpretation of the moment. However, I think it goes deeper than that.",739
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"For some reason, this story is regarded as some great love story. But the reality is, that Heathcliff and",740
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,Catherine never belonged together. They never should have been together.,741
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,Close up on Pacey's face.,742
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"Catherine was essentially a mess, Heathcliff was basically a decent guy who had a lot to learn about life and was inherently better off without some whimpering, mentally unstable wet rag following him around.",743
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,Nellie and her friend look at each other in disbelief.,744
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,The whole thing was wrong. It should never have happened. Bronte should have saved her ink.,745
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"Pacey watches her, aware of the direct meaning toward him. The bell rings in the background.",746
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,Mr. Gold's film class. Dawson is sitting in the back of the class listening to the conversations of the students.,747
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Gold,"(walking down the aisles) So, we'll have to move fast if we want to enter the film festival.",748
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,"We can make it. The script is done, the movie is boarded. And we did a lot of the work over the summer.",749
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,"Nellie sits behind him, listening attentively, twirling her hair around her finger.",750
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Gold,Then let's move onto the story. Have you solved your third act problem?,751
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Gold,Dawson raises his hand.,752
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Mr. Gold?,753
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Gold,"(annoyed) Yes, Dawson?",754
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Would that be the Boston Film Festival?,755
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Gold,Yes that would be. They have a junior video level competition.,756
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Gold,"Dawson stares at his desk, uneasy.",757
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,"Okay, Third act. I've just been injured in the big game with Tyler. My throwing arm crushed. The bone broken in 3 places.",758
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,Cut to Dawson's disgusted face. Nellie nods and smiles at everything Cliff says.,759
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,"(continuing) But I refuse to tell the coach, because he won't let me play at Homecoming if I do.",760
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,"Remember we want the audience asking, ""Can he do it? Will the team win the big game?"" Remember, this is autobiographical, so if anybody has any questions, I was there. I lived it. Come talk to me, alright?",761
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Stage directions,(he smiles),762
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,Cut to Dawson taking out books from his locker. Joey stands with him and listens.,763
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"""Helmets of Glory."" Chronicles last year's football season. And get this, Mr. Cliff Quarterback himself is writing, directing and starring in it.",764
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(rolling her eyes) Oh, a Streisand.",765
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"This is serious, Jo. They're entering it in the film festival. *My* film festival. This is like immediate competition.",766
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,And it's a sports film?,767
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,A thin and pedestrian sports film.,768
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Ah, the epitome of everything you're against. (she wrinkles up her nose and leans against a locker)",769
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Could life be more cruel?,770
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Dawson looks down the hallway to see Cliff walking up to Jen. Joey also notices.,771
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,"Hi, I'm Cliff.",772
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Hi, I'm Jen.",773
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(watches) This isn't happening.,774
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,"I know being the new kid can be kind of traumatic but if there's anything I can do to take the edge off, show you around, take you out?",775
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"(smiling) That's, that's really sweet of you. Umm, can I let you know? I mean, I'm still just getting settled in.",776
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,"Sure, sure, absolutely. (pause) And it was nice to meet you Jen, short for Jennifer.",777
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"You too, Cliff, short for Clifford.",778
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"She strides past Dawson and Joey, looking back at Cliff and smiling to herself. Dawson and Joey just look on.",779
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"I told you, Dawson. They move fast in New York.",780
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Dawson starts to say something but stops and just looks down the hall after her.,781
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,~~~~~~~~~~Part Two~~~~~~~~~~,782
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Mitch is standing at a table working on his restaurant plans. Dawson hops down the stairs carrying the head model of Joey.,783
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Dad, hey Dad. Have you seen my camcorder?",784
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,Filming today?,785
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Yeah, Joey gets decapitated.",786
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,"It's, uh, in my bedroom, on the night table, on your mother's side. You might want to take the tape out.",787
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"(making a face) You can get arrested for that in some states. (pauses) Umm, I have a question.",788
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"It's kind of a girl slash relationship question. And I don't want it to go to your head that I'm soliciting fatherly advice or anything. But, cause I clearly don't condone yours and Mom's perverse s*x life but I'm not too proud to admit that my own inexperience is hindering my current female relations.",789
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,"Well, what's the question?",790
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Mechanics of kissing.,791
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,How can I help?,792
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,Dawson sits down next to his father.,793
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Well, I'm interested in technique.",794
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,"Well, there is no technique, Dawson. You just put your lips together and go.",795
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Well, what makes a great kiss?",796
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,The first time I kissed your mother--,797
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(interrupting) Now don't get too detailed.,798
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Cut to Joey walking to the Leery house and to the ladder leading up to Dawson's room.,799
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,And we were out on a boat. And your mother's lips were chapped from the sun and she asked if she could borrow my chap stick. So I took it out and I put some on my lips and then I leaned over and kissed her.,800
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,Joey is seen entering Dawson's room and into the upstairs hallway,801
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,"(continuing) The chapstick was really smooth. It slid onto her lips, the sensation was amazing. The chemistry was already there, you know but it was just one of those things that cemented it, you know. It was unforgettable and most importantly, romantic.",802
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,Joey looks over the balcony and sees Dawson and Mitch talking.,803
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"And here, I thought you were all about s*x.",804
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,"Oh, we still jumped each other. (Dawson grimaces) But you got to have romance. It's all about romance...and chapstick.",805
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,She squats down and listens to them.,806
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"But the kiss itself, What did you do?",807
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery-,"Well, here (holds up the head of Joey) Give it a try.",808
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,No!,809
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mitch,"Oh, come on. This is a big father/son moment here. You asked for it.",810
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mitch,Joey smiles and tucks a piece of hair behind her ear.,811
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Alright.,812
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Dawson takes the head from Mitch,813
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,Now moisten your lips and go for it.,814
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Dad, this is ridiculous.",815
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,It's your bottom lip. You got to keep it relaxed. (Mitch pulls on Dawson's bottom lip) You want to let it have a mind of its own. You want it to dance with hers. (pause) Close your eyes.,816
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,"Dawson holds the head up, closes his eyes and kisses it. Joey is watching and when he goes to kiss the head, Joey closes her eyes as well. She opens them slowly after a moment.",817
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,That was good.,818
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Yeah?,819
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,Yeah.,820
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Cool. Umm, forget this ever happened.",821
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Alright, thanks.",822
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Dawson gets up, grabbing the head and leaves the room",823
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Joey gets up but a noise distracts her. She hears Gail's voice and finds that Gail is in the closet, whispering to someone on the phone. Joey stands by the door listening.",824
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"Yeah, Alright. No, no, okay, then I'm hanging up. (kissing noises are heard from Gail) I",825
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"promise, I promise. Good-bye.",826
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,She hangs up the phone and opens the door to the hallway,827
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"(surprised to see Joey) Ahhh, Joey. What are you doing?",828
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Uh, I was just looking for Dawson. We're filming today.",829
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,(nervously) Oh that's nice.,830
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Yeah, I'm going to get k*lled today.",831
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"Oh that's nice. Ah, Be careful out in the sun. It's hot today. Wear sunblock.",832
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Ah, see you later, Mrs. Leery. (she starts to walk away then turns back to Gail) Mrs. Leery?",833
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,Hmm?,834
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(after a slight pause) I know.,835
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Gail is obviously startled and watches as Joey leaves.,836
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Cut to the filming of the movie on the pier. Joey is shown walking down the dock,837
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(calling out) Steven? Steven?,838
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Joey sees a bloodied shirt and bends down to pick it up. Pacey dressed as the Creature appears and Joey screams. She punches him and then picks up an oar and slams him in the stomach with it. He goes down as Joey runs to hide behind an old boat. She stumbles to the ground but picks herself up and ducks behind the boat. The head model of Joey is held up and Pacey knocks her head off with the oar. Fake blood squirts out.,839
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,And cut. Beautiful.,840
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Dawson changes the film while Jen helps him out with the equipment.,841
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,Guys that was really good.,842
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Perfect. That could not have gone any better.,843
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"(taking the head off of the Creature suit) Joey, you die so well! Dawson, can we get another one of those? 'Cause I so love that image.",844
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"No, we're behind schedule. Moving on.",845
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Joey smiles sarcastically at Pacey and turns around, her smile fading. She goes onto Dawson's screened porch and begins to change out of her bloodied clothes. Dawson and Pacey are seen in the background cleaning up. Jen enters and goes over to help her.",846
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"(carrying a towel) Hey, Joey let me help you get that blood off.",847
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,It's okay. I can get it.,848
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"No, come on. I don't mind at all. It's not a problem. (Joey gives in and lets her help) Ewww, it looks like it's really stuck on there.",849
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"I, I can get it.",850
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Joey begins to take off her bikini top.,851
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Here, let's get you covered up (Jen puts a towel around Joey's chest area) You have nice breasts.",852
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Stage directions,"(Joey stares at her) I mean, don't get the wrong idea. I'm completely hetero, all right. I'm just commenting girl to girl. You have a really nice body.",853
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(self-conscious) I'm too tall.,854
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"(washing the blood off of her) No, you're not at all. You're commanding. Hey, come on, I wish I had your stature and your long legs. My body's a mess. I'm too short, my hips do this weird thing and my face is shaped like a duck. Oh, and I hate my breasts.",855
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(stares at her, surprised) Are you serious?",856
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Yeah, I mean, it's completely normal to hate the way you look.",857
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(debates over it, then decides to say it) You don't look like a duck.",858
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"(smiling slightly) You know, that's the nicest thing you've said to me since we've met.",859
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Joey looks away, regretting the compliment. Jen turns to leave, then pauses and turns back to Joey.",860
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Joey, I plan to make it really hard for you not to like me.",861
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Joey watches her leave, tightening the towel around her, an uncertain look on her face.",862
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Cut to Dawson and Joey filming the next scene. Pacey and Jen are on the lawn playing their characters,",863
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,Steven and Penelope,864
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,Don't worry. I'll help you find your cousin.,865
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,That's so sweet of you. I can never thank you enough..,866
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Pacey leans over and kisses Jen. After a few seconds, Jen tries to pull away but Pacey won't let her.",867
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Whoa. Whoa, Cut! Cut, Pacey, what the hell are you doing!",868
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"(finally pulling away) I'm kissing, what does it look like?",869
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Snorkeling! It's not the way it's scripted. (looks at Jen) Are you okay?,870
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,(laughing) Yeah I'm fine.,871
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(smiles) It's just a kiss, Dawson.",872
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"And you know what? Honestly, I think we should have another. Yeah?",873
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,Jen laughs some more.,874
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,No. No. No kiss. I'm cutting the kiss. It's out.,875
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Wait a second, you can't cut the kiss.",876
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Yes I can. I just did. All right? It's not working. It doesn't make sense to have our new character to be kissing her dead cousin's boyfriend. All right? The kiss is officially cut.,877
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"All right. So, then is that a wrap cause I got plans tonight, you know?",878
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Yeah, it's a wrap.",879
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Yeah, I probably should be going too. Bye you guys.",880
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,Jen goes to leave.,881
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Hey, Jen, wait up.",882
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Dawson takes after Jen and Pacey and Joey are left standing next to each other,883
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,And what are you up to this evening?,884
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"Well, it just so happens that the woman of my dreams is going to be at the school dance tonight and I plan on attending.",885
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(smirking) Lucky her.,886
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Cut to Jen and Dawson walking by the fence leading up to her house.,887
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"So, in honor of the school dance, I've rented Saturday Night Fever, Staying Alive and Grease.",888
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,In the lieu of going?,889
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Yeah, It's going to be a John Travolta night of interpretative expression. See, this way, we can dance and our feet never have to move.",890
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,I can't Dawson. I'm sorry.,891
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,What? You have more enticing plans?,892
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,(hesitating) Actually I'm going to the dance,893
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Oh.,894
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,I'm sorry. I didn't know you wanted to do the whole movie night thing.,895
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,It's okay. Are you going alone?,896
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"No, actually uh, Cliff Elliott asked me. He thought it would be a good way to meet some new people.",897
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Okay.,898
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Come on, don't look so down. It's not like it's a date or anything. He just asked me if I wanted to go and I said yes.",899
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"(shrugging) Ok, well call me confused but that's the definition of a date, Jen. Isn't it?",900
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"(sighing) I know. You're right. I just wanted to go, you know. I mean, I'm new here and it just sounded like fun. Why don't you drop by and we can dance.",901
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"No, I got a date with Travolta. I wouldn't want to disappoint him.",902
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Well, see you later.",903
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Dawson Ok, see you.",904
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,(enters into her yard and shuts the gate behind her) Bye.,905
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(off-screen) Cliff.,906
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Cut to Dawson and Joey in his room. She lays on the bed watching him pace back and forth.,907
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Cliff Elliott. What's that about? I don't get it. How could she be attracted to him? What's he got?,908
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Well, we could start with his chest measurements and work down.",909
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"No, no, no, beyond the external. (tapping his head) There's nothing going on up here. It's head fumes. The guy, he's a lightweight. His script is ludicrous, his story sense is even worse.",910
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"I don't think a cinematic process is the attraction, Dawson.",911
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"What kills me was she was so open about it. You know, like 'I'm going to the dance with Cliff', like it wouldn't bother me. I mean, I respect her candor and all but it's a little on the thoughtless side.",912
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(nodding) Completely thoughtless,913
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"(sits down on bed) At this very moment they're slow dancing. Her arms are wrapped around his waist and they're moving to some stupid cheesy 80's song, and he's whispering things into her ear to kinda make her giggle and toss her hair off to the side. (Joey gives him a look) Every once in a while their eyes meet and they shift awkwardly because they know it's all coming down to that one moment at the end of the night where he leans over and tells her what a great time he's had. He asks her if they can do it again, and she just smiles in that sexy, teasing way that she has, it's not really teasing, but just sexy and says ""I'd like that."" (Joey rolls her eyes) And then their lips meet. Their mouths come together. Their tongues find each other, I...aauugghh! (he flops back on the bed) I can't take it.",914
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,You're so dramatic.,915
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"I don't get it! I don't get it, what did he do that I didn't do?",916
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(sits partly up, looking at him) He asked her out!",917
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(getting up) I'm going to the dance.,918
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,What?,919
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(going to his closet) I'm going to the dance.,920
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,What?,921
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,It's my only recourse.,922
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Why?,923
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,'Cause Jen is there.,924
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"In the arms of another man. I mean, why torture yourself?",925
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,I'm an artist. Tortured is a prerequisite. Are you coming or not?,926
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Look at you Dawson. I mean, this little movie plot you got going on is not going to end the way you want it to.",927
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(changing into a nicer shirt and vest) I'm the one who should be kissing her Joey. Not some,928
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,JCrew ad. I can do it. I can make my bottom lip dance tonight. It's going to happen. I am going to kiss the girl.,929
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(lies back down) This is so pathetic Dawson but (she turns to look at him) I'm not above witnessing your hormonal su1c1de so, count me in.",930
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Give me two seconds. I've got to check my hair,931
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Joey looks at him strangely.,932
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Cut to Joey coming down the stairs. She walks over to the kitchen and peers in on Mr. and Mrs. Leery.,933
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,We probably won't discuss this until after the dinner itself. I might be late.,934
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,She goes over and kisses him. Joey leaves.,935
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,We'll sh**t for tonight.,936
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"Mrs. Leery walks out of the kitchen and heads for the front door passing Joey, sitting on the stairs.",937
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(not looking up) Goodnight Mrs. Leery,938
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"(startled) Joey, you scared me. Ah, look we need to talk.",939
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(standing up) Do you remember my mom, Mrs. Leery?",940
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,I just want to clear up this morning.,941
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"My mom was the best. She was an incredible woman. My dad, however, didn't always see that. He cheated on her for as long as I can remember and it tore her apart. Crippling their relationship and nearly destroying the entire family.",942
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"Why are you telling me this, Joey?",943
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Because your actions affect others. They bleed into the lives of those around you and...,944
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Gail,You don't understand...,945
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(interrupting) No, you don't understand. My mom got cancer and died so you do the math. You know your reasons for doing what you're doing? (pause) They can't possibly outweigh the everlasting damage you're creating.",946
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,(sighs) Does Dawson know?,947
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(off camera) Know what?,948
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,He comes bounding down the stairs. Joey and Mrs. Leery stare at each other.,949
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,How to dance. I just told her we were going.,950
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(smiling) I know how to dance.,951
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(smirking) Yeah, right.",952
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Dawson gives his mom a kiss on the cheek. He runs off and Joey turns to leave also.,953
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Have fun tonight, Mrs. Leery.",954
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,~~~~~~~~~~Part Three~~~~~~~~~~,955
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"The school dance at Capeside High. Pan over kids dancing to ""I Want You"" by Savage Garden. Jen and",956
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Cliff are standing next to a table drinking punch.,957
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,"Fortunately, this is a victory dance",958
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Ah, did you make the winning play?",959
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,"Well, you're here aren't you?",960
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"(laughing) You know, that could have been my exit cue but you somehow pulled it off.",961
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,I sold it?,962
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Yeah, you're smooth yet unassuming. It's very enduring. Is there anything you're not good at?",963
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,Yeah. Dancing. I'm rhythmically challenged.,964
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,(challenging) Prove it.,965
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Cliff takes Jen's hand and leads her onto the floor, where they start to dance.",966
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,Pacey walks in and spots Tamara who is chaperoning the dance She whispers in another teacher's ear.,967
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,He walks up to her.,968
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"Good evening, Ms. Jacobs.",969
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"(not thrilled to see him) Hello, Pacey. How are you this evening?",970
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"Confused, perplexed, bewildered, mystified. The source of emotion.",971
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"You know, I'm the chaperone and I should make the rounds",972
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,Would you like to dance Tamara?,973
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"(turns around) That's not a good idea, Pacey.",974
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"Of course it's not a good idea. But if things were different, would you?",975
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,(smiling) I...I have to go.,976
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"Dawson and Joey arrive at the dance and see Jen and Cliff dancing to ""All I Want"" By Savage Garden.",977
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,Cliff is definitely proving his point.,978
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(smiling as she sees them) Ahhh, they make such a cute couple. (turns to Dawson) What exactly is your plan?",979
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(watching) I didn't get that far.,980
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Well you better write something quick, because in some world sectors, what they're doing is known as foreplay.",981
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Shots of Jen and Cliff dancing.,982
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(thinking) Do you dance?,983
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(shaking her head) No.,984
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(taking her hand) Now you do. C'mon.,985
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(aggravated) Dawson, this is certifiable.",986
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"It's easy. You just move around, shake your ass back and forth.",987
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"They reach the dance floor. Just then, the song ends and a slow one comes on. The camera pans over to various couples moving to the music. Joey and Dawson each look around, not quite sure what to do.",988
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Dawson steps toward her and takes her hand in his. Joey stares, overwhelmed, over his shoulder.",989
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Dawson searches for Jen.,990
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,We lost her,991
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(staring up at him) Maybe she's with your brain.,992
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Dawson twirls Joey around him, still looking for Jen. She's confused, but plays along. She comes back around him and he stares at her, smiling.",993
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,You're pretty good at this,994
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Joey offers a slight smile as the mood turns and their eyes search each other's.,995
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Hey, you guys",996
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"The moment is broken. Jen and Cliff are next to them, swaying to the music.",997
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Hi.,998
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,You made it.,999
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Yeah.,1000
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Ah guys, you know Cliff?",1001
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Hi.,1002
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Hi.,1003
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,We have film class right?,1004
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Not exactly. It's my study hall base.,1005
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,But Dawson is a very talented filmmaker.,1006
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,Oh yeah? You're into movies?,1007
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,I dab.,1008
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,Cool.,1009
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(trying to be smooth) I'll see you.,1010
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Dawson dances Joey away.,1011
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,That went brilliantly.,1012
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Cut to Jen leaving for the hallway. Pacey stares at Ms. Jacobs. Dawson notices Jen and runs after.,1013
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(out of breath) Hey,1014
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Hey, Dawson. Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you.",1015
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Yeah? You know, here and there.",1016
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,I was hoping we could dance.,1017
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,What about Cliff?,1018
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"(amused) Well, if you'd rather dance with him...",1019
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,You know what I mean.,1020
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"It's a song, Dawson, A three-minute distraction from life.",1021
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,He might get upset. You being his date and all.,1022
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,(annoyed) Forget I asked.,1023
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Jen...,1024
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Jen enters the girl's bathroom. Dawson pauses for a second and then goes in after her. He quickly exits when girls start screaming.,1025
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Sorry.,1026
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Cut to Joey and Dawson are sitting at a table. Joey is watching Dawson stare at Jen and Cliff.,1027
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,This is embarrassing. Let's blow.,1028
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"No, I'm enjoying my misery.",1029
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Cut to Jen surrounded by Cliff and his jock friends.,1030
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"While you stand here on the dock pontificating, little U.S.S. Jenny is sailing farther and farther out to sea. Haven't you had enough?",1031
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"No, I'm still breathing.",1032
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Dawson, you hardly even know this girl",1033
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"I know. That's the magic of it, Joey. True, Jen stepped into my life no more than two seconds ago but already I feel that connection. The bond that we're meant to be together. You call a wish fulfillment and delusion of the highest adolescent order, but I'm telling you something *primal* exists between us.",1034
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"You're scaring me Dawson. You're doing this Frankenstein/Hyde thing. I mean, one minute you're",1035
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Dawson, the next you're his psycho alter-ego. I mean, you're the sea creature from your own movie.",1036
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"So be it, Joey. I can't explain it any better, Jo. The girl's a mystery to me, but I feel like I've known her my whole life. (pause) I mean, it's like the way I feel about you. (Joey stares at him) She challenges me the way you do, she could be you. Except...she's Jen.",1037
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Joey looks away, trying to conceal her hurt.",1038
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Well let me just remind you how you're little allegorical horror movie slash love story ends. The creature doesn't get the girl. He dies a violent, bloody, horrible death. Rest in peace, Dawson. It was nice knowing you.",1039
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Joey gets up to leave.,1040
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Where are you going?,1041
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"I'm already dead, remember?",1042
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Dawson looks over at Jen and Cliff as a slow song comes on and they step out onto the floor.,1043
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(getting up) It's time for a rewrite.,1044
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Dawson taps Cliff on the shoulder while Cliff is dancing with Jen,1045
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Umm, excuse me. I'd like to cut in.",1046
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"What are you doing, Dawson?",1047
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,They've stopped dancing.,1048
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"I said I want to cut in. I'd like to take over. Umm, I'd like to thank you Cliff for showing Jen such a great time for the greater part of the evening but I'm here now in sound mind and body, and I can take it from here.",1049
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,What are you talking about?,1050
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Yeah, Dawson. What are you talking about?",1051
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"You and me. Me and her. Cliff, I know it's kind of confusing right now but all you need to know is that Jen and I have something going on and it's a little bit raw and undefined right now but it's my time to clarify the situation. So I'd like to ask you to manly step aside so I may have a moment with the object of my desire.",1052
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"(upset) Dawson, what are you doing?",1053
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,"Hey, you're going to have to leave right now, okay? This is too weird.",1054
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,No. I think you need to go. I'm staying.,1055
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,"What's going on, Jen? Do you want to be with this guy? (to Dawson) Why don't you just go?",1056
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,A crowd begins to form around them.,1057
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,No. Why don't you go?,1058
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Cliff,And if I don't?,1059
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,I haven't thought it through that far.,1060
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,I'll tell you what. I'll make it easy for both of you. I'll go.,1061
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,Jen leaves and the camera closes in on Dawson's face as he watches her go.,1062
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,~~~~~~~~~~Part Four~~~~~~~~~~,1063
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Joey, Dawson and Pacey are walking down the street towards the pier",1064
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"This could be the single most embarrassing night of my life. I'm a simp. Joey, how could you let me do this?",1065
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"See, I knew this was going to turn against me some how, where this would all be my fault.",1066
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"And Pacey, my non-existent friend.",1067
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"Sorry, man. I was otherwise engaged.",1068
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"At least I didn't desert you, *I* came back!",1069
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Who's the mystery woman you keep alluding to?,1070
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"Unfortunately, the mystery woman remains a mystery even to me.",1071
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"(depressed) You know, at this moment, Jen's lips are probably pressing against Cliff's.",1072
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(sighs) Don't go there.,1073
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,You know what? It's my stop kids. Manana.,1074
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,Pacey leaves and heads down towards the pier. Joey and Dawson continue walking down the street.,1075
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,Cut to Mr. Leery is sitting at the kitchen table. Mrs. Leery walks in carrying a doggie bag of food from the restaurant.,1076
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,Hi,1077
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,Hi hon. How'd it go?,1078
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"Okay. I brought you a doggie bag. Oh, is Dawson home yet?",1079
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,I think our son is busy kissing the girl next door for the first time tonight.,1080
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"(massaging his shoulders) Oh, sounds romantic.",1081
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,"Ummm, remember our first kiss.",1082
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"Of course I do. It was our first date. You took me to the movies, the one where Mary Tyler",1083
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,Moore was just this horrendous mother.,1084
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,Ordinary People.,1085
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,That was it.,1086
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,No that wasn't it. That was our second date.,1087
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,Wait. It was in your car at a stoplight. I remember you leaned over and you kissed me.,1088
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,No,1089
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"Yes, it was.",1090
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,I can't believe you don't remember our first kiss.,1091
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,(she heads to the fridge) I remember. I don't think you remember.,1092
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"No, I remember every moment. It was the single most vivid moment of my life thus far.",1093
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"Honey, I'm sorry. It's late and I've had a long night.",1094
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,And there I was giving our son advice on how to deliver the most memorable kiss only to discover that I'm a utter failure.,1095
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,Gail sneakily pulls out a tube of chapstick and puts it on.,1096
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,"Umm, I know. We went for pizza. It was that terrible restaurant where you rubbed the red pepper into your eye (she sits in his lap).",1097
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,"Third date. You know, you just need to quit.",1098
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mr. Leery,She interrupts him and plants a kiss on him. They stand up as the kiss grows more passionate until she breaks it off.,1099
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mrs. Leery,How's the lips? Still chapped?,1100
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mitch,They need a little more.,1101
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mitch,"They kiss again, then hold each other. Gail looks over his shoulder, troubled.",1102
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Mitch,Cut to Pacey walking down the pier when once again he spots Tamara.,1103
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,This cannot be happening.,1104
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,He walks over to where Tamara is standing.,1105
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,Ms. Jacobs?,1106
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"Hi, Pacey.",1107
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"You know, I feel this strange familiarity creeping over me.",1108
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,I thought it might be appropriate.,1109
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,Give us a chance to do it all over?,1110
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"Only change the ending. I'm sorry, Pacey, about my behavior. I mean, this is without question, the most absurd thing I've ever done. Not to mention punishable in a court of law.",1111
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,It was just a kiss.,1112
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"No. It was more than that. (pause) What I did was deadly wrong and I could stand here and try to explain to you my hopelessly troubled state of mind. Because you do deserve an explanation for my behavior but well, instead of feeding you ten years of therapy, I was hoping that maybe I could get by with a simple apology? And hope that I haven't left any permanent scars...I am sorry, Pacey. What I did was wrong and I am sorry.",1113
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"Now, where do you get off taking all the responsibilities for this. I may just be fifteen, but I'm well beyond the age of accountability.",1114
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,"Maybe not within the confines of the judicial system, but for me. (sighs) My lips kissed back. Right? I",1115
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,kissed you back.,1116
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,Fair enough.,1117
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,And you know what? I don't regret that at all and you shouldn't either.,1118
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"But this can't happen again. From now on, our relationship is strictly teacher/student. I want that clear.",1119
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,And if I were to object?,1120
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"Well it's not up for discussion. You know, it has to be this way, Pacey, for all the obvious and non-obvious reasons.",1121
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Pacey,(sad) This is so unfair. (honestly) I'm not good with girls and I finally meet someone...,1122
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,"Don't worry, Pacey. That will change, Trust me. Good night.",1123
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,Pacey reaches and grabs her arm as she tries to leave. She turns back to him and they kiss.,1124
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Tamara,Cut to Dawson and Joey still walking down the street.,1125
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Jo, let's assess. What have we learned from tonight's 90210 evening?",1126
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,That we should always stay home on a Saturday night and watch movies because the remote on the rewind of life does not work... [sic],1127
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"No, it doesn't. But that won't be a problem now that I officially ruined it with Jen. It's really over.",1128
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"It never began, Dawson.",1129
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"You know I do feel like the monster from my movie. There's something inside me that I can't control. It's like I have no balance anymore. Everything's either high or low, hot or cold, black or white. It's like there's no middle ground, anymore. I mean, nothing's just okay.",1130
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(sighing) I'm too tired to philosophize, Dawson.",1131
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Do me a favor? If I get like this again, and I'm sure I will, before this adolescent growth process is over, well next time just chain me to my bed and wait for my moment of clarity to come?",1132
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(smiling wickedly) Can I use leather straps?,1133
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(still confused) Not until you explain the Crisco.,1134
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"(laughing) You are such a sphincter. You really are. I mean, I can't understand how someone so self-aware can be utterly clueless.",1135
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Dawson smiles then looks down the street and sees Jen buying taffy from a vendor. She then steps over to the balcony of the pier and stares out at the water. Joey watches also.,1136
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"(moaning pitifully) Oh man, What do I do?",1137
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,(shrugs) It's your call.,1138
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Well, I pretty much bastardized the evening. I may as well complete it.",1139
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,'Til there's no one left standing.,1140
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Can I bag on you Jo?,1141
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Yeah you can bag.,1142
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(punching her on the shoulder) Wish me luck.,1143
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"pauses for a moment, just looking at him.",1144
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,"Good luck, Dawson. I hope you get your kiss.",1145
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Joey,Dawson waits till she leaves then heads toward Jen. He walks up behind her. She senses him there.,1146
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,(still looking out at the water) I'm beginning to feel like your TV set.,1147
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,I don't know what to say first.,1148
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"A first. (turning around) I am really angry, Dawson.",1149
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,I know.,1150
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,What do you want from me?,1151
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,I want to know what's going on between us?,1152
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,And does that question need to be answered tonight?,1153
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Sorry about tonight, Jen. I got scared. Scared I was becoming the friend.",1154
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"(upset) Oh God, the friend. How awful.",1155
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,It is awful. I feel like I'm becoming a friend you come over and tell all your boy adventures to. I,1156
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,don't want that to be the case. I want to be your boy adventure.,1157
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,They both hear voices and look at a couple that are on a houseboat celebrating.,1158
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,Can't you be both?,1159
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"(pauses) No, not at fifteen, you can't. It's too complicated.",1160
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,"Jen looks away, pausing to think.",1161
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"(slowly) So, I'm interested.",1162
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(surprised) In what?,1163
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,An adventure. What do I have to do?,1164
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,(moistening his lips) You can kiss me.,1165
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Jen laughs a little and turns back to the water. Dawson looks a little hurt.,1166
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"You know, I really am a cliché, Dawson. In New York, I was moving fast, I was moving really, really fast. So fast I kept stumbling and falling. But here I feel like for the first time in a long time I'm walking at a steady pace and (she turns back to him) I'm afraid that if I kiss you, my knees may buckle and I may stumble and I don't know if I can handle it now.",1167
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Music drifts from the houseboat. The couple stands and begins to dance to ""You Don't Know Me"" by",1168
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,Jann Arden. Dawson and Jen both watch until Jen turns smiling shyly to Dawson.,1169
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,Would you like to dance?,1170
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,Here? Right now?,1171
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"(smiling) I've wanted to dance with you all night, Dawson.",1172
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,They move towards each other and begin to dance.,1173
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"(softly) See, the kiss is just the end result. It's not what's important. It's all about desire. And wanting.",1174
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Dawson,And romance.,1175
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"(smiling and looking up into his face) Yeah, and romance.",1176
Dawson's Creek,1,1,Jen,"Jen sighs and lays her head on his shoulder. Dawson looks amazed that he's even there. Cut to Joey walking up the street, watching them. Her downcast face says it all as the camera draws closer. Cut back to Dawson and Jen dancing. The camera pulls back and the music fades.",1177
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,You are such a wuss.,1178
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,"You rot. That's it, its over.",1179
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,No you don't.,1180
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,*Joey and Dawson fight over the remote. Joey gets it.*,1181
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,That movie sucks.,1182
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,"Don't you dare, that movie rules.",1183
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,"Yeah right. Next? I mean, I don't like watching these stupid horror movies that are loaded with cheese whiz, okay?",1184
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,"Forgive me Roger Ebert. But I figured in honor of Friday the 13th tomorrow, a little horror marathon was mandatory.",1185
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,"Its tired Dawson, just like these movies. I mean, you have this fascination with the dark side. You enjoy scaring people, in particular, me.",1186
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,"I love the adrenaline rush. Besides, horror films provide positive examples of ordinary people overcoming their worst fears and conquering evil.",1187
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,"Save it for film class, Dawson. I mean these movies are unnecessarily violent and exploitive, and completely pointless to society.",1188
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,Prude.,1189
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,*Joey turns on the TV. The news is on.*,1190
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,"There's enough fear, death and evil in this world without having to recreate it on film. I don't need to watch some stupid man in a mask slice up girls. The world is already a scary place.",1191
Dawson's Creek,1,10,News Reporter,"*on tv*And now tonight's lead story. Authorities fear that the lady k*ller has struck again. The body of 18 year old, Amanda Ferris, was found in Boston this morning. Believed to be now the 5th victim of the serial k*ller that's been--",1192
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,"See, see what I mean. Case and point. Why do we need these horror movies to remind us on how sick and demented the world really is. Huh?",1193
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,You talk big Joey. And you aren't going to sell out. But its been deflecting the real issue.,1194
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,Which is?,1195
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,"You are a grade A, 100%, scaredy-cat wuss.",1196
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,Sure.,1197
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,*Joey turns on Jerry Maguire*,1198
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,Better. *she watches until she looks over and finds Dawson gone*,1199
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,"Okay, Dawson, where are you? Where'd you go? Dawson? You're not scaring me here, you're not. Dawson? Dawson, you're so predictable, I swear. You just like your *Joey looks over the bed, and Dawson pops out with a mask on leaving Joey with a frightened look on her face.*",1200
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,"You know Joey, I think you're the one that's predictable.",1201
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,Dawson. C'mon.,1202
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,Theme to Dawson's Creek,1203
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Pacey,"Alright, you can tell me Dawson. What's your plan?",1204
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,What are you talking about?,1205
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Pacey,"Its Friday the 13th. It's your favorite night of the year. And your parents are out of town. So what movie are you going as, huh? Michael Myers or Norman Bates' mom?",1206
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,Its not going to happen tonight. No more life imitating movies for me.,1207
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Pacey,"Wait a minute, what did I just hear?",1208
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,"I swear it. I'm done trying to turn my life into some exciting movies. You know what, I just end up getting disappointed. Like when I started seeing Jen, I thought, 'Okay, you know what, from now on, everything is going to be some big epic romance. Tortured and passionate and romantic, have some big happy ending. It wasn't that at all. The characters were flawed and uninspired, the love was amateurish at the least. And the ending was definitely not happy. It wasn't even tragic, it just ended.",1209
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Pacey,"What are you trying to say, Dawson? I mean its Friday the 13th and we have a serial k*ller within striking distance of Capeside, you're just going to treat this like any other night?",1210
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,Yep.,1211
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Pacey,"Come on, no midnight seance, no corpses falling out of the cupboard?",1212
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,Nope.,1213
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Pacey,"Bummer man. *Pacey opens his locker, and a corpse falls out*",1214
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,Sucker.,1215
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,*CUT TO Jen in class and Cliff walks in.*,1216
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Cliff,Hey Jen.,1217
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Jen,Hi. What are you doing here? This isn't your class.,1218
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Cliff,"Yeah, do you want to go out tonight?",1219
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Jen,That's abrupt.,1220
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Cliff,I'm kinda under the bell here.,1221
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Jen,"Cliff, I don't know. I'm kinda down on the whole dating thing after what happened last time.",1222
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Cliff,I guess the guy you dated wasn't any fun.,1223
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Jen,"What are you talking about? Dawson's fun. He is, he's probably the, the most original and imaginative date on the planet.",1224
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Jen,*Joey enters*,1225
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Cliff,"If that's how you feel, why aren't you going out with him now?",1226
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Jen,"Long story, Cliff.",1227

Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,Did you guys know that he likes to stalk his victims? Usually comes in contact first in notes and phone calls.,1503
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Ursela,Really?,1504
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,"Yeah. That's how he got that girl down in North Carolina. He sent her notes, and then followed her home after school one day. He would peek through her window. And then he'd call, pretending to be somebody else.",1505
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Pacey,That's creepy.,1506

Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,I have a contradicting personality. Please continue.,1513
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,"Okay. So anyways, he called her and learned that she's going to be home alone that night. She lived in a town where nobody locked their doors. He disconnected her electricity, cut off her phone, walked right through the front door, up her stairs, into her bedroom while she was sleeping, and cut out her heart in one clean sweep. He used a long lacerated scaupul, so they think that he might be a doctor or something.",1514
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Ursela,You know what makes that story so scary?,1515
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Jen,Its true.,1516
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Pacey,"You know, you think stuff like that never happens but it always does.",1517
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Cliff,"I got a story. Its true too. A woman with a newborn was out to the country to pick blueberries. Alright, she leaves the baby in the back in his little car seat with the door open so she could hear him if he cries. She goes out picking in the blueberry patch, after about a half an hour, she realizes she hasn't heard a peep from the baby.",1518
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Ursela,Uh oh.,1519
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Cliff,"She runs back to the car, looks in the back and a huge snake has crawled down the throat of the baby, its tail wagging out. So, in major shock, she reaches in, yanks the snake out. And long with it, comes all the baby's insides.",1520
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Jen,"That's not scary, that's disgusting.",1521
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,That's nasty.,1522
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Jen,Pour baby.,1523
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Ursela,"I have a scary story. There's this young kid, this boy. Who goes to the convenient store and picks up this woman. She's wild you know, and crazy but pretty. And he takes her back to his friend's house where they're having all these like fun and games. And what none of them know is that this woman is a little ill, you know, like in the head. The result of years of abuse. And that in her purse, she carries this great big knife. Because sometimes, just for fun, she likes to slice open throats and see how far the blood would spurt.",1524
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Ursela,*The rest look at her and the lights go out. They all scream*,1525
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Ursela,What the hell? This freaks me out.,1526

Dawson's Creek,1,10,Pacey,"Oh, and coming from you that really hurts.",1547
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Joey,What's that supposed to mean?,1548
Dawson's Creek,1,10,Pacey,"What about your taste Joey? You're gonna go to your grave pining away for your best friend. The guy that is so oblivious he doesn't have a clue that you lust after him morning, noon, and night.",1549

Dawson's Creek,1,10,Dawson,You can say that again.,1584

Dawson's Creek,1,11,Joey,"It's a blue-blooded tradition that celebrates the grand achievment of being born rich.

Dawson's Creek,1,11,Jen,"Look Joey. Now that the proverbial wedge, recently referred to as Dawson Leery, is no longer between us, we could actually be friends. I know, I know, it's a bizarre concept, but we may find we have something more in common than just the boy next door.",2100

Dawson's Creek,1,11,Jen,Are you kidding me? Pacey is going to enter the Miss Windjammer pageant?,2155
Dawson's Creek,1,11,Dawson,Why not? Last year Ashley Elliot successfully sued to join the boy's football team. I think it's one of the more intrepid things that Pacey has ever done. He pulled the gender gap wide open.,2156

Dawson's Creek,1,11,Dawson,Very funny. Is this some kind of exposé for the paper? Get out! Joey Potter entering a beauty pageant? This is classic.,2163
Dawson's Creek,1,11,Joey,"Oh, I see. You think I'm such a barking car chaser that a D student with a Julius Caesar haircut has a better shot than me? Thanks a lot.",2164
Dawson's Creek,1,11,Dawson,"Joey, no. I know how you feel about these things. This is so not you. Why didn't you tell me?",2165
Dawson's Creek,1,11,Joey,"Because I knew you'd make me feel like an even bigger idiot than I already am. And believe me Dawson nobody's laughing harder at this than I am.

Dawson's Creek,1,11,Jen,"In New York I didn't exactly hang out with a lot of other girls. Okay? I mean I've never even had close girlfriends. And as far as I can tell, neither have you. I don't know, don't you ever feel like you're missing out on something.",2189
Dawson's Creek,1,11,Joey,"Well, why don't you just go hang out with the Capeside peps club. I mean, associating with me won't exactly send your popularity points soaring up the social Richter scale.",2190

Dawson's Creek,1,11,Dawson,"Pacey if you want to win this thing you've got to take it seriously. If you win, the press is going to be all over this thing, CNN. I mean, this could be international news.",2197

Dawson's Creek,1,11,Dawson,"Who's your inspiration, role model, or mentor in life?",2248

(She glances over the side at the stage where Hannah is watching her.) People who think that they're better than you are. People who think that material things, or being pretty or popular automatically makes you a worth while human being. I'd like to tell today's youth that none of these things matter unless you have strength of character, integrity, sense of pride, and if you're lucky enough to have any one of these things....don't ever sell them. Don't ever sell out. So when you meet a person for the first time, please don't judge them by their station of life, because, who knows, that person just might end up being your best friend.

Dawson's Creek,1,11,Joey,"I thought this was what I wanted. You to see me as beautiful. For you to look at me the way that you look at Jen. But the truth is, I don't want that at all Dawson.

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,It's not that simple Joey. It's about creating the perfect moment.,2909

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Joey,You can't storyboard a kiss.,2911
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,"Sure, you can.",2912
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Joey,"It's not reality, Dawson. These movies that you're watching are false images that don't exist outside the city limits of Hollywood.",2913

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,It's called a stereo.,2922
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Joey,And it doesn't come with a sunset or starlit summer night either. And I'm personally offended that this movie mentality where we're supposed to believe that Brad Pitt and Sandra Bullock are going to magically drop down from the sky and sweep us off our feet.,2923

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,"Guys, guys, you need to create some dramatic tension. There's a formula to it, that's all. Anybody ever see Rocky or the Karate Kid?

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Tamara,"You got me, Pacey. I never expected you to get this far.",3132
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Pacey,So Miss Jacobs was bluffing?,3133
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Tamara,Your reward is your education.,3134

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Tamara,"I tell you what, I'll owe you.",3136
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Pacey,"It's okay, Tamara.",3137
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Tamara,"No, it's not. Pacey. This is my place of employment.",3138
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Pacey,"It's late. There's no janitors, no film crew, everybody's gone home for the night. It's just you and me.",3139
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Tamara,Pacey.,3140
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Pacey,What? What's the matter?,3141
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Tamara,"You know, you're right. Let's do it. But where should we do it? I know, how about my desk? Our first time should be on my desk. Strip. Hurry up we don't have much time. Better drop 'em.",3142
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Pacey,I know what you're doing. You're calling my bluff to see how far I'll go.,3143
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Tamara,"No, no, no, I'm deadly serious. Take them off.",3144

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Tamara,"What is this your first time, Pacey?",3150
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Pacey,You know that it is.,3151
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Tamara,"Go home, Pacey. You need to find a girl your own age. Not some insane middle-aged woman.",3152
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Pacey,"Please, Tamara.",3153
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Tamara,"Please no buts. This can't go one second further, it's beyond wrong. You have to understand that.",3154

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Joey,We're pretty much just Manhattan bound.,3162

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Joey,"Well, I don't think so. I kind of like it.",3168
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Anderson,What's there to like about it?,3169
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Joey,"It's the priveledge of existence. Think of the options, you could be stuck in a small town like this where nothing exciting ever happens.",3170
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Anderson,It's not the education. It's the boarding life. Seems kind of unnatural. Separated from your family. It just doesn't seem fair.,3171
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Joey,"Yeah, I keep telling myself I'll get used to it, but I never do.",3172

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Anderson,"Well, I assumed that you did.",3181
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Joey,And what makes you think that?,3182
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Anderson,"The way you carry yourself. You're really hands off. It's like a clear radio signal. I guess if I was dating somebody, I'd want them to give off the same vibe.",3183
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Joey,And how would you feel if she sailed to a deserted beach with some mystery man?,3184
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Anderson,"As long as she didn't keep a secret. Didn't lie about it. The truth doesn't hurt, it's the lies that k*ll you. Honesty is still the primary quality I'm looking for in a girl.",3185

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,There's actually a technique if you brace your arm..,3191
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Nellie,Did you say something?,3192

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,How's it going out there are they ready for the all important cheerleaders?,3198
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,"Hardly. They haven't even gotten the beautiful take of the first scene. Let's just say as a director, your friend, Cliff, makes a great quarterback.",3199
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,"Well, we can't all be prodigys.",3200
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,But Helmets of Glory? Can you even say it with a straight face?,3201
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,Barely.,3202

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Anderson,Are you saying everyone on the wine commission lied?,3212
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Joey,"All I'm saying is Kevin Costner was pretty convincing in JFK. I mean, I can't believe you actually read the report. Isn't it like a million pages?",3213
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Anderson,I was curious.,3214
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Joey,There's curious and then there's sand models of Dallas. Have I told you about my UFO theories?,3215
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Anderson,What?,3216
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Joey,My UFO theories. How they swoop sometimes destroying entire cities?,3217

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,"Well, it's a little schmaltzy considering it's a horror film.",3339
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,"I was going for the tragedy. See, the monster is dead but in his death Penelope finds understanding. She comes here to her secret place to say goodbye. It's themeatic. Plus it kind of balances out all the blood.",3340

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,You do?,3342
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,Yeah.,3343

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,That was amazing.,3348

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,It was perfect.,3350
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,"Well, I had a good director.",3351
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,And I had a good actress. So...,3352
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,So..,3353
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,"It's a shame to waste all this good production design. The sunset, the music, the soft candlelight.",3354

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,Dawson you were videotaping a really private moment.,3365
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,Let me explain. I wanted the moment to be perfect between us. I wanted to create something special. Worthy of how special I think you are.,3366
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,Dawson you try too hard. You're over zealous.,3367
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,It's my downfall.,3368
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,Why can't you just let the moment exist why do you feel the need to make it happen?,3369
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,"I just, I do. I don't know what else to say Jen except my intentions are nothing short of honorable. I've never met anyone like you before and you scare me.",3370
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,I scare you?,3371
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,And I love the way you scare me but it makes me nervous and then I do or say something stupid and try to come up with ideas to make me smart so you won't think I'm stupid and then those ultimately backfire making me seem even more stupid. It's all a vicious cycle and I'm really at the end of my rope here Jen because all I want to do is kiss you and if I don't kiss you soon I'm going to explode.,3372
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,"Oh, you know Dawson this really sucks.",3373

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,Oh no.,3392
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,What?,3393
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,We've got to hide. Let's go.,3394
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,Where are we going?,3395
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,I don't know.,3396
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,"Who's coming? Okay, so what do we do?",3397
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,Huh?,3398
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Dawson,*Two people are in the ruins (It's Pacey and Tamara.)*,3399
Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,"Dawson, this is really gross and it smells.",3400

Dawson's Creek,1,2,Jen,Ew there's like stuff in my hair.,3403

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Those eyes, that hair...",3409
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Well, I grant you that the girl has certain physical attributes but nothing so original or mysterious to want perfection.",3410
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Okay, easy.",3411
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"I mean, a face like that leaves nothing to the imagination. The well-maintained good looks of an upper-middle class New Yorker. There's no mystery there. I can see her entire future in that pose.",3412
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Really?,3413
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Yeah. In three years her above average SAT scores will grant her admission into a small liberal arts college somewhere in New England where she'll major in...art history before returning to Manhattan to marry a bond trader she meets some Saturday afternoon at America's cup watching party. Within a year they move to suburban Connecticut, refurbish an old farm house, and raise three neurotically perfect children.",3414
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,You've put quite a bit of thought into this.,3415
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,Not really. It's just so obvious.,3416
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Well, to be honest, I think I prefer to let Jen surprise me, okay?",3417
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,Suit yourself. I'm just trying to save you some time.,3418
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Can you hand me that B roll (?) over there?,3419
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,*Joey hands it to him.*,3420
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"(cont.) By the way, I'm taking suggestions on what to get my parents for a suitable anniversary gift. I'm at a total loss. I mean, what do you get two people who have spent every day together for the past like 20 years?",3421

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,*The video that was shot at the ruins of Pacey and Tamara is playing.*,3423

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,I didn't sh**t this.,3425
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"I think we found the perfect anniversary gift, Dawson. What is this?",3426
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"I don't know, I swear, I didn't sh**t it. I must have left the camera running when we ran out of the ruins.",3427
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,You know it's not without a certain quality.,3428
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Very watchable.,3429
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,Yeah.,3430
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"It's funny, that woman looks familiar.",3431
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,I know what you mean. If you brushed her hair out of her eyes a little....,3432
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,And maybe sat her behind a big school desk...,3433

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,The very same.,3440
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,Wait a minute. You have a tape of Tamara?,3441
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Oh, I'm sorry, Pacey. I know you thought she was saving herself for you but...",3442
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,I was sh**ting some pickup at the ruins with Jen and we accidentily left the camera running when we ran out and the rest is pornographic history.,3443
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"*Dawson, Joey, and Jen start laughing.*",3444
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"God, that's really strange. Um, you can't tell who that guy is or anything, can you?",3445
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Standard over the shoulder shot we can't see the guy's face.,3446
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,So if you're thinking of tracking him down just look for the guy with the brown hair and throbbing neck muscles.,3447
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Uh, Dawson I think, uh, I think I should get to take a look at that tape.",3448
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Sure, we'll arrange a private screening for you.",3449
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Yeah, so you can flag the bishop in privacy.",3450
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,You know that's really clever how you turn all the sexual repression into humor.,3451
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"You know what, you guys? I'm late, I should get going before Grams puts on the APB(?).",3452
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,I'll walk with you. Later kids!,3453

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Well, I hardly ever talk about it.",3460
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"I know, that's why I keep sticking around.",3461
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,*They lean in to kiss but Jen catches a glimpse of her Grams in the window so she pulls away.*,3462

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,I take it we're not alone.,3464
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"Practically a menage a trois. Just look at it this way, Dawson. Repressing desire can only make it more powerful. So the next time I see you, we are in for one titanic kiss.",3465

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Grams,Do you do these things to upset me Jennifer?,3472
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,It was only a kiss Grams.,3473
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Grams,Only a kiss. I seem to remember a lot of trouble back in New York starting after only a kiss.,3474
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"You know, your definition of trouble is broader than anyone's I know.",3475
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Grams,Then why don't you tell me why you think your parents sent you here?,3476
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"Why don't you remind me Grams? I haven't heard a resitation of my sense for what, like, 15 minutes?",3477
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Grams,"I don't do this to tortue you, Jennifer, I do it so you won't stray down the same path twice.",3478
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"You know what, Grams, I'm bored of this. Of the way we talk to each other, of these conversations that we have that go round and round in these incredibly pedestrian circles and we say the same things over and over again. So let's just end this right now. What you saw outside with me and Dawson, Grams, was only a kiss.",3479

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Gail,*Dawson comes in.*,3486
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Mitch,"Hey Dawson, I want you to hear this. Your mother just told me that she's never before seen this scar underneath my chin, can you believe that?",3487
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,You mean the one that you got from that mo-ped accident like 10 years ago up in the cave?,3488
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Mitch,"Yes! Thank you, Dawson. Thank you very much. You see there, my son knows my face better than you do. Maybe you should start coming home early. See my face in the daylight for a change.",3489
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Mitch,*He leans down and kisses her. She pulls him back down for a more passionate kiss.*,3490
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Don't bother, I'll show myself out.",3491

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Yeah?,3502
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"You know, maybe I haven't been entirely honest with you lately. I mean, not that I've lied to you or anything, just withheld some details.",3503
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Okay...,3504
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Well, I'm not cursed with self awareness like you are, Dawson, but I know enough to know how people see me. I mean, I'm not the guy who gets the girl. The guy who talks about getting the girl, but not the guy who gets her. Enough people say that stuff about you and you start to believe it yourself.",3505
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,I'm not quite following you here Pacey.,3506
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"I got the girl this time, Dawson.",3507
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,What?,3508
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Yeah. Call it the law of averages, call it an act of God, call it whatever you want, but I got her.",3509
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Who? Pacey, who'd you get?",3510
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Oh man, you know what, Dawson, I don't know how to tell you this but the guy with the brown hair and the throbbing neck muscles..the guy with Tamara Jacobs...uh, that's, that's me.",3511
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,No...,3512
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Yeah. I'm not just talking this time though, but, oh, I wish I was 'cause off the top of my head I could think of about 40 reasons why this tape could ruin my life. The least of which is the embarressment factor, I mean, no guy's first time should be captured on video.",3513
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Are you crazy? I don't think there currently exists a word to describe my reaction.,3514
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"But, I like her Dawson, I really do. And it's not just the s*x, man, I don't know, maybe this is too improbable and bizarre to ever work out.",3515
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Bizarre might be a word, yeah.",3516
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Yeah. Uh, this is, this is gonna sound a little strange but on the tape, I, did I look alright? Performance wise, did I cut it, man?",3517
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Yeah, you did fine, man. I mean, from what I could tell, yeah, you did fine.",3518

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Dawson, your parents are middle-aged, white suburbanites, they live for (missed the word again.).",3525
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"You should see my parents lately. It's disgusting. They're like, half the time they're making out or dry humping in the living room. You know, what's sad is I'm actually jealous of my parent's s*x life.",3526
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,What do you mean? Blondie isn't giving you any. I thought by now you would of uh..,3527

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,Real thrill.,3540
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Bob,"Uh, listen your mom was just helping me out with a little wardrobe problem. Seems that station research has indicated, well, viewers like me, they hate my sportcoats. Anyways, it's wonderful to finally meet you Dawson. Your mother has told me all about your film, being a bit of an indy fan myself, I'd love to take a look at it whenever it's done.",3541
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Sure. Okay, yeah.",3542
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Gail,"Oh, uh, we really should get back to the prep session.",3543

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Bye mom.,3546
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Gail,Bye Joey.,3547
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"You know, it's funny, when I first saw Bob on television I thought he was a real tool but I don't know, now that I've met him in person he doesn't seem so bad. What do you think?",3548

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"Your worst fears are founded Grams, I'm going to see Dawson. And, maybe I'm just asking for it right now, but I would rather you say whatever it is you're thinking than continue to look at me the way you are right now.",3552
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Grams,You know that boy only wants one thing from you.,3553
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"No, no. That's not Dawson at all. He's completely sweet and honest and romantic.",3554
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Grams,And him and that Potter girl. The way she climbs in and out of his bedroom window. I don't even want to guess.,3555
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"No, Dawson and Joey are just friends. Sure, I mean maybe there's some of that sexual tension thing that happens when a guy and a girl have been friends for so long but that's as far as it goes. And as far as Dawson and me go, Grams, you saw the entire highlight reel yesterday afternoon.",3556
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Grams,So I'd be correct in assuming you have certain feelings for him?,3557
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"Yeah, you would.",3558
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Grams,"Well, nothing can be done about that. I just hope that you can avoid making the mistakes, that you and I both know girls your age often make.",3559
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"You always find a way to get that last dig in, don't you?",3560
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Grams,"Oh, Jennifer, you exasperate me, everything I say isn't meant as criticism.",3561

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Oh, whatcha reading?",3568
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,"Oh, just the approved tenth grade reading curriculum, I'm trying to choose the next book for our class. Any suggestions?",3569
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,How about something with a little action in it this time?,3570
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,Action?,3571
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Yeah, s*x. I mean, what is our school board so afraid of? We're practically adults now, we can handle this stuff. A few blue novels are not going to k*ll us.",3572
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,Pacey. Every piece of literature that you read this year will have s*x in it. Everything you read last year probably as well.,3573
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"But it's not real s*x. I mean, it's s*x as a cautionary tale, s*x is a warning. I'm not kidding about this. Every time somebody in one of those books has s*x, something bad has to happen to them. Romeo and Juliet. They have s*x, next thing you know they're k*ll*ing themselves. The Scarlet Letter. Ester Prinn has s*x and next thing you know she's an outcast for life. The, uh, Greek one...",3574
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,Edipus (sp?)?,3575
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Yeah, that one! That guy sleeps with some chick, who granted is his mother, he's so freaked out by it, he pokes out his own eyes. Okay? That's not real life. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it has been known to happen, that every once in awhile, two people sleep together, they enjoy it, and afterward everything works out fine.",3576

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,Really great.,3589
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Um, I still have a lot of pre-dubbing to do tomorrow down at my mom's station. They let me use the equipment down there without too much hassle so um, but would you like to come along?",3590
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"Yeah, it sounds cool.",3591
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Yeah? Really?,3592
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,Why are you so surprised everytime I jump at the chance to spend time with you?,3593
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,I don't know. Natural skepticism perhaps?,3594

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,*Dawson walks over and sits next to Jen on the bed.*,3596
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"You know, in the old movies, whenever two characters were in bed together the censors always made one of them keep one foot on the floor. Which I never really understood because I figured if the characters were clever enough they could still do almost anything.",3597

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Guy,"Sure, yeah. Seen your mom this morning yet, Dawson?",3604

But, I mean, we always seem to have something to say to each other, even if our conversations are more banter than real talk, you know, fun and sweet and everything, but kind of on the surface. What I'm trying to say is that if you want to talk to somebody about this, I mean, really talk, I mean, I know we've never done that before, but I'd really like to be that person.",3615

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,People always know.,3623
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Well, we didn't. Right? Joey? I didn't know. Did you? You knew. How could you not say anything?!",3624
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,Why? So you could hate me for telling you because you know that's what would have happened. Besides I thought you would have seen it by now.,3625
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,What?,3626
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Well, you're a pretty perceptive guy, usually. I think we can agree that you've been a little preoccupied.",3627
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,What are you talking about?,3628
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"I'll give you a hint. Blonde hair, about the last stages of a B-cup.",3629
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Don't turn this into a discussion about Jen. Joey, you lied to me.",3630
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,I didn't know how to sa--,3631
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,What? What are you threatened by Jen?,3632
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Threatened, Dawson? No, I'm not threatened, I'm bored.",3633
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,You're bored so you lie to me to curve your own boredom.,3634
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,I was trying to be your friend.,3635
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"No, Joey, what you did was not the action of a friend. What you did, and let me make this perfectly clear, is disengage this friendship.",3636
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"No, Dawson. I was trying-- and I didn't-- I didn't know how to--",3637
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Searching for something to say, Joey? At a loss for words? Don't worry. Your actions are far more articulate. Bye....see ya later...have a nice life.",3638

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Things got a little crazy.,3644
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Gail,Sorry I missed you. Honey? Is there something bothering you?,3645
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"No, I'm fine.",3646
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Gail,"Uh huh, well I don't believe you. You've never been good at disguising that look of preoccupation you get when something is bothering you. Okay, let me guess, one of the many women in your life has got your head spinning?",3647
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Something like that.,3648

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Grams,"Yes, what can I help you with?",3651
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Two things actually. First of all, I know you don't like me. You look at me like some sex-crazed teenager looking to corrupt your granddaughter, but I want to assure you that that's not the case. Not at all.",3652
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Grams,What's the second thing?,3653

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"I don't know, maybe it's me, I mean, maybe I have these old-fashioned ideas about fidelity which I obviously inherited from my father's side of the family. Oh, I'm sorry, am I starting to bore you?",3657
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,No.,3658
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,'Cause I think I'm starting to bore myself.,3659
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"No. Not at all, Dawson. I mean, I'm glad that we can talk about this. I was a little hurt earlier when you wouldn't say a word to me and I was sure you ran to pour your heart out to Joey.",3660
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Well, I won't make that mistake again. Do me a favor Jen. Promise me that you'll always be up front and honest with me.",3661
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,Okay.,3662
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"It's not just a passing remark. I firmly believe that secrets destroy. They wound and hurt to k*ll and I really want us to have a chance. Okay? So no secrets between us, ever.",3663
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"Yeah, yeah, I mean, but, don't you think that in certain situations there are things that people just don't want to know.",3664
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,No because even if my mom had fallen completely out of love with my dad then she should have been honest with him.,3665
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"I'm not talking about your parents. I mean, don't you ever wonder why two months ago I suddenly came to live up here?",3666
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Well you told me it's because your grandfather's sick and your grandmother needed your help.,3667
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"My grandmother's been an RN for the past 40 years, the only thing I can help her with is staying out of her way.",3668
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Okay...so why are you here?,3669
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"Okay. Honesty, right?",3670
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Yeah.,3671
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,My parents didn't exactly send me up here to help out Grams. They sent me up here because the cliches about teenagers in the big city are true.,3672
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,What cliches?,3673
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"Come on, you've heard them. They grow up too fast, stay out too late, hang out with the wrong kind of people, have s*x to young...",3674
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Your parents wanted to get you away from kids like that?,3675
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"No, Dawson, I was kids like that.",3676
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,The s*x part?,3677
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,Yeah.,3678
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"With a boyfriend, right?",3679
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"Yeah, but not just to him.",3680
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Okay. So all that stuff you said about being a virgin before I should probably disregard that.,3681
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"And you know what? Maybe I'm just being completely self destructive here because I like you and I know that the timing is off and everything but you know this is at your request. And you know what? You should be honest. You should know who you're dating. You're okay with this, right?",3682
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Yeah. I mean, you know, the way I thought you were talking it was going to be much worse.",3683
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,Dawson?,3684
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,What?,3685
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,Would you hold my hand?,3686
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Yeah. Sure.,3687
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,Hey! I missed you this morning.,3688
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Came in early. Movie stuff.,3689
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"Oh so anyways, I was kind of feeling like blowing off my lab report if you want to go to a movie or something?",3690
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"That sounds great, but you know what? I'm so behind in my homework that I don't think my GPA can afford it.",3691
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"Okay, well, maybe just a quick study break then.",3692
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Okay, yeah, I'll call ya.",3693
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,Yeah?,3694
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Definitely.,3695

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,Question of the day. Do you think if someone is having an affair with multiple partners they should tell both partners of the arrangement?,3701
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,"An informal survey, Pacey?",3702
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Oh, no, I think you'll think this is relevent what with STD's and AIDS running rapid. Not to mention the moral involvement.",3703
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,"No, I agree. If you were intimately involved with someone else, I'd want to know.",3704
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Me? Oh, no, no, no, don't turn this around on me.",3705
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,Don't turn what around?,3706
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,The issue.,3707
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,And what's that?,3708
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,Well do you like him or do you like me?,3709
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,You know you're very disarming when you start sounding your age.,3710
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"I saw you two at lunch yesterday and today again in the hallway laughing together, the way you brush his arm. Who's it gonna be Tamara? Me or Mr. Gold?",3711
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,"You know, I never knew you were so bothered by this, Pacey, because I'd hate to think I have to choose. I mean, Benji and I have so much in common. We love to talk about books and authors, and we're both big opera fans, not to mention our legendary man troubles.",3712
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,Man troubles?,3713
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,"Yes. Apparently, in your extensive research, you failed to detect that I'm not exactly Benji's type.",3714
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,No?,3715
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,Not unless you think I bear some resemblence to Mel Gibson.,3716
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,Mr. Gold is gay?!,3717
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,Shhh. It's not to be repeated.,3718
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,So I don't understand. Yesterday at the cafe when I tried to hold your hand...,3719
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,And because we were in a public place where any number of students or teachers or parents could see us I didn't let you.,3720
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,Oh.,3721
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,"Pacey. If you're confused about us, if you're trying to make sense out of what's happening between us, the best I can tell ya is so am I.",3722

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,Hey. I think you owe me about 7/8ths of a conversation.,3726
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Yeah, I guess I do.",3727
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"I mean, it's probably just my own pathetic insecurities but I want to talk more about what we said last night. Are you sure you're okay with it?",3728
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,I'm fine with it.,3729
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,Really?,3730
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Yeah, besides Jen it's in the past. It's over and done with. Even if I really did have a problem, what could I do about it?",3731
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,You could tell me.,3732
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Tell you what, Jen? You tell me I'm supposed to say something but I don't know what it is.",3733
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"Well, then let me help you out. You could tell me why you've been avoiding me all day, or what's behind that look in your eyes, whether it's repulsion or jealousy or complete disapproval because I know I've never seen it before. You could tell me that you suddenly feel strange about us, that maybe we need a little break because you don't seem to know me and maybe you never really did. Or, and now I'll make it really easy for you, you can just tell me if I've left anything out. I didn't think so.",3734
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,*CUT TO Video store.*,3735
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,So it wouldn't bother you?,3736
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,Why would it bother me?,3737
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Because she's not a virgin. Because she's had s*x with other guys.,3738
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"You see, this is what I don't understand about you Dawson. If the woman I was hot for came up to me and in some confessional way told me she wasn't a virgin, don't you see what she's doing for you?",3739
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,No.,3740
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,You don't see it.,3741
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,I don't.,3742
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"She's giving you an in. She's saying, ""Look, I understand that you're a little nervous about making the first move on me because you're some romantic who puts women like me up on a pedestal so here, I'm going to give you the greatest gift any desireable woman can give to a sexually inexperienced guy.""",3743
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,An in?,3744
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Exactly! She's saying she wants it just as bad as you do, man. Your carnal needs a reciprocal.",3745
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"This is not about s*x Pacey it's about romance. You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?",3746
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Yeah, I do.",3747
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,No you don't because what I was going to say before this the world according to Pacey speech is this has nothing to do with the stupid in or even getting Jen in the sack. It has to do with one thing.,3748
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"The fact that you are scared. Face it. Dawson, the Jen Lindley you have built up in your mind does not entirely exist, okay? In your movies, she can be whatever you want, but in real life, the scripts got thrown out.",3749
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,So it seems.,3750
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"All I can say is enjoy it, man. Life has some pretty unexpected benefits.",3751
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Yeah, I could do without all the unexpected plot twists though. The virginal girlfriend--",3752
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,Is not exactly a virgin.,3753
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,And the high school strike out artist,3754
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,Is now having an affair with his English teacher.,3755
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Then there's also the happily married couple who's celebrating they're 20th wedding aniversary tonight who's really not as happy as we thought.,3756
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Yeah. That sucks, man. Have you talked to your mom?",3757
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Nope, change of plan.",3758
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,"Dawson, I thought you said you were going to tell her.",3759

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"So tonight's the big night, huh?",3764
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Mitch,Do you have any idea how long 20 years is?,3765
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,No..,3766
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Mitch,And that doesn't even include the 4 years your mother and I dated.,3767
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,There's something I've got to talk to you about.,3768
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Mitch,"Most of our college friends are already on their second marriages by now. We all got married at the same time, early 20s, which is a little young by the way.",3769
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,I admit that there's a strong possibility that this is not the right time for this.,3770
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Mitch,"But you know, after 20 years I can still say the same thing I did then. Can't imagine my life without her.",3771
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Dad.,3772
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Mitch,What?,3773
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,There's something I've got to tell you.,3774
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Mitch,Sounds serious. What is it?,3775

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,And in what field do you consider me an expert in?,3787
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,Dawson Leery.,3788
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"You know, I'm sort of busy here with these receipts and locking up maybe we could do this another time.",3789
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,I told him I wasn't a virgin.,3790
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,I think I have a minute.,3791
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"It's just that he seemed so disappointed in me, which of course made me angry and now I don't know where we are.",3792
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Well, let me tell you about Dawson. Granted he's articulate for his age but he's not exactly mature. He's the classic only child. He pouts when things don't go his way and he only sees things in black and white. Anything else confuses him.",3793
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,Yeah.,3794
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"And when it comes to women...there are popes who have had more experience. I mean the guy was a shrimp until last summer. To say his s*x life is limited is the understatement of the decade. It's barren. A desert. I don't envy what you have to deal with, believe me.",3795
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,"You're not trying to scare me off, are you?",3796
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"No. I'm just trying to say that every guy that grows up to be one of the good ones...he was probably a dweeb with girls when he was 15, too.",3797
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,So what would you do?,3798
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Same as you. I'd get hurt, mad, confused, ask people for advice, maybe the wrong people, and then I'd wait.",3799
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,For what?,3800
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"For him to grow up, come around, everything.",3801
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Jen,And how long does that take?,3802
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,Don't go by me. I'd probably be stupid enough to wait forever.,3803

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,"Some, yes.",3809
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,A lot?,3810
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,"Well, not a lot that mattered.",3811
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Pacey,And how many was that?,3812
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,That mattered? You want numbers?,3813
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,*Pacey nods.*,3814
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Tamara,"Well, let's see. There was one in high school, one in college, since then I'd say uhhh there's been three. But no one for a few years.",3815

You know, between you and me, I don't even know what the big deal is. I mean, in two years, nearly 55% of my peers will have had s*x, and in five years, in 5 years it will be almost 100 and nobody will care when I did it. But as for now, it's an unfortunate and major deal. Who knows? Maybe by the time you wake up a 15-year-old girl with a shady past won't be such a bad thing.",3822

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Jen. She came and talked to me. I told her sit tight, he'll be back..",3828
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Thanks. Appreciate it, Joey.",3829
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,I explained to her that it's just displaced anger and you're just mad at your mom and dad.,3830
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"I'm mad at the world, Joey. I'm a teenager.",3831
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Oh, and by the way, we're old pals now, Blondie and I. So, uh, if you have any messages you want to get back to her, let me know.",3832
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Look, whatever you've done, thanks, but I don't want to talk about it right now. With you.",3833
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,Come on. Passing up a chance to dish about the girl of your dreams? I thought that's what you did with your friends.,3834
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,It is. Except I'm not sure that we are.,3835
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,How droll. The tables have been turned.,3836
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"This isn't just about yesterday Joey. It's last week, last month. Everything between us recently, we're not getting along the way we used to.",3837
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,So the friendship? You don't think we're friends anymore?,3838
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,I don't know. Are we more? Are we less? All I know is it's just not the way it used to be. Nothing is anymore.,3839

Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Yeah, and I'm sure it was a wonderful wedding.",3846
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Oh, the best.",3847
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"We each brought dates, I assume.",3848
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Yeah. Jen was by my side throughout.,3849
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"And at the end of the evening the inevitable question, who to take home the date or the wife?",3850
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Mmm..a dilema.,3851
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Fascinating. Faced with the choice you stood, surveying your options, your eyes drifted slowly from her, to me, back to her.",3852
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,And back to you.,3853
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,"Yeah, but I was off having a drink with the rich guy at the bar.",3854
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,Till moneybags got fresh and you needed somebody to bail you out.,3855
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Joey,I don't remember that part.,3856
Dawson's Creek,1,3,Dawson,"Oh, I do. Clear as day, absolutely. You were definitely in need of a rescue.",3857

Somebody does somebody wrong and then they go on TV with their IQ of 3 and bitch and moan about it for the whole world to see.

Another man. Having s*x with another man. Now I won't be so insulting as to offer an apology. This is, after all, on the other side of forgiveness. I just thought that you should know, Mitch.

Dawson's Creek,1,4,Mitch,"Ah, Phoebe. And from the minute Phoebe introduced us, I knew that I loved you. I mean, it was that quick, you know, because love comes that quick. It's like a decision. Love is a decision that you make and I made it, right there on the spot. What I need for you to know is that our love came quick and it's lasted. It's weathered the storm. But as quickly as I made that decision 20 years ago to love you, I'm taking it back. I don't want to love you anymore. I choose to hate you now.",4235

Dawson's Creek,1,4,Dawson,But Jen I'm--,4251
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Jen,"No, no, hear me out, Dawson, please. Okay? Because this seems to be the day of truths, and I'm taking my turn. I lost my virginity when I was 12 to some older guy who got me drunk, I don't really remember his name but after the first pregnancy scare I went on the pill, and I used condoms most of the time, some of the times, I don't know, it's kind of blurry. I was really drinking a lot and having blackouts and stuff, um. I was sexualized way too young, and I don't wish that on anybody. I mean, s*x at such a young age, more often than not, is a bad idea. I finally got caught having s*x in my parents' bed. Daddy's little girl fornicating right before his very eyes. He still can't look me in the face but then again he shipped me 200 miles away so he wouldn't have to, but Dawson I'm not that girl anymore. I never really was, and I'm not that white-as-snow image you've got either, I'm somewhere in between and I'm just, I'm just trying to figure it out.",4252
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Dawson,"Jen. It's not you. It's my own stupid hang ups. My parents have this raging s*x life and I just, I secretly used it as their measure of happiness.",4253
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Jen,"Well, s*x doesn't equal happiness.",4254
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Dawson,"Yeah, I know. I know that now.",4255
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Jen,"I'm sorry about lying to you, but I can't apoligoze for my past. I mean, I've learned from it, I'm a better person, it's gotten me here. And this is my chance to start over. It's my chance and it would be really nice if you'd be a part of that.",4256
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Dawson,On one condition?,4257
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Jen,What?,4258

Dawson's Creek,1,4,Pacey,"I just have one more ""if"" question. I got it, I got it. If you could do any one thing in your life again, what would it be?",4267
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Tamara,"Well I wouldn't have married an abusive, fat stock broker. Same question, back at you.",4268
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Pacey,"Well, I'd be older, so I could tell the world about this wonderful woman who I am rapidly falling in love with. Did you really think that it was going to make me jealous by flirting with Deputy Doug?",4269
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Tamara,Flirting? I don't flirt.,4270
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Pacey,"Because if you did, it's succeedingly unnecessary. I'm already jealous of every guy who's ever been in your field of vision, who's known the smell of your hair, who's held your body against his.",4271
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Tamara,"We're getting sloppy, Pacey. You know we're going to have to end this. It's getting too dangerous.",4272

Dawson's Creek,1,4,Mitch,So why'd you do it?,4278
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Gail,"Get ready Mitch, because if you think it can't get worse, it can. My reason is proposterous. I have no reason. No. I woke up one day, Mitch, and I realized, my life was perfect. Everything I'd ever wanted from the time I was 6 had been realized. I discovered perfection obtained is a discomforting state. And I got restless. What do you do when everything is right? When everything is just the way you've always wanted it to be? I have the perfect home, a career, the most gifted child, a husband who stimulates me mind, body, and soul everyday of my life. I want for nothing. And I guess that left me feeling empty not wanting. And I just wanted to want again. So, I set out to achieve it, and boy did I succeed. Because what I want now, I want back everything that I've lost. Mitch, I'm so sorry.",4279
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Mitch,"Shhh. Let's just sit here, alright? I don't want to talk anymore.",4280
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Gail,Okay.,4281
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Stage directions,(Dawson goes into the room and finds Joey sitting by the window.),4282
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Dawson,"I was hoping you'd still be here. Joey, I owe you an apology. I have been thoughtless and insensitive and self-obsessed to the extreme. But if you give me a chance to rectify my belligerent ways I promise I will make every effort to be friendworthy of you.",4283
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Joey,Well that was a mouthful. I'm sorry for using the mother card. I keep it in my back pocket and it's way too easy.,4284
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Dawson,"Jo, I don't know what I would do if I lost my mother.",4285
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Joey,"It hurts, Dawson. I mean, you're born and you die and you make a lot of mistakes in between, you know? Funny thing is, you know? Now that she's gone, I, I can't seem to remember a single mistake.",4286
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Dawson,"What can I do for you, Joey? I want to be a good friend, what can I do?",4287
Dawson's Creek,1,4,Joey,"Well, just for tonight, can we put our rapid ascend to adulthood on hold, please?",4288

Dawson's Creek,1,5,Joey,Hate to cut the festivities short but Bessie is due next week and she needs extra help around the house.,4298
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Dawson,"Come on, Joe. Bodie can take care of anything Bessie needs. Plus, You can't leave now we've only watched one movie. We've never watched just one movie on movie night.",4299

Dawson's Creek,1,5,Stage directions,(Cut to Jen sitting on a chair.... to your suprise.),4301
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Jen,A night of first's all around.,4302
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Joey,"And, What are you talking about?",4303
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Jen,"Look, I'm talking about the obvious, which I know we've all tried our best to ignore. But it's easy to see that I have intruded on a very personal ritual here, And clearly, my presence is making you uncomfortable. So, I'll tell you what, Joey. You stay and watch another movie. I'll just go.",4304
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Dawson,"No, wait Jen. You don't have to do that.",4305
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Jen,"No, Its ok. I mean, you and I have decided to slow things down. So, I am sure that a few hours apart won't k*ll us. Besides, Grams has kinda been on the w*r path, meaning, once she see's Joey leave, there is no way she is going to trust you and I alone. So, so I should just go.",4306
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Joey,"Well don't leave on my account. I mean, I'm not interested in ruining anyone's evening.",4307
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Jen,"No, no. Its not you at all. Don't, don't take it personally.",4308
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Dawson,Great. Settled. Next issue. What to watch next.....(He is interrupted by Jen),4309
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Jen,"Ok this is no solution,Joey. If we both stay we're going to be stuck in the same uncomfortable position we've been in all night.",4310
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Dawson,All right. So let me get this straight. Movie night has been reduced to the following: (Dawson's talking to Jen) You can't stay if she leaves because your grandmother wouldn't permit it. And you can't stay if she stays because its awkward.,4311
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Jen,Yeah.,4312
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Dawson,(To Joey) And you can't stay if she leaves because you feel like you have driven her away. And you can't stay if she's here because it ruins movie night for you.,4313
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Joey,Well put.,4314
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Dawson,Well since this is my house. And we assume that I can't go anywhere. According to my calculation that only leaves one option.,4315
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Joey and Jen,Night Dawson.,4316

Dawson's Creek,1,5,Jen,"Well she's carefully considered all possible scenarios, detailing a god-like source. And she has found them unconvincing. And ,while she respects those who chose to believe in a higher being, she herself does not. Simply put Grams, she grew up.",4348

Dawson's Creek,1,5,Pacey,"No we don't go out, We stay in.

Dawson's Creek,1,5,Tamara,Pacey thats sweet but It's hardly practical.,4356
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Pacey,"It doesn't have to be in Capeside. We can go, we can go down to Providence. Ok. We'll have dinner. Catch a movie. Nobody there knows us down there. We'll be just like all the rest of the dysfunctional couples out for a good time on a Saturday night.",4357

Dawson's Creek,1,5,Jen,ok. Thats nice and everything but...,4375
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Dawson,Ok. That's nice but I was hoping for something a little more illicit (Illegal) than that.,4376

Dawson's Creek,1,5,Dawson,Um...Maybe we can still nip this in the bud. Who told you?,4382
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Jen,"The question should be who didn't tell me, Dawson. Its out there. Its prevelent.",4383
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Dawson,We gotta go find Pacey.,4384
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Jen,"Wait, Dawson. Is it true?... Dawson?",4385

Dawson's Creek,1,5,Pacey,"Ya know I really appreciate that effort Dawson but it really is that bad. Ya know what lets be honest it's worse. This is cataclysmic. This is one of those rare mile stone events that separate the first half of your life from everything that follows. Ah, My only consolation is the faint hope that this doesn't reach Tamara. So,ya know , If you would just allow me a moment here for me to symbolically drop my chin into my chest, and let me feel really really sorry for myself. It would be much appreciated.",4397
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Dawson,"Ok, Pacey. Granted, This doesn't look good but this is in your hands, you could control this now.",4398
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Pacey,Its the wrong time for the Obe-wan moment Dawson.,4399
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Dawson,"No, listen to me. As far as your concerned, the only thing worse than a rumor is a substantiated rumor. If you walk out that dorr hanging you head, doing the whole, whoa is me thing. Its as good as admitting thats its all true. But if you go through thse halls, Like you couldn't care less, Like this is the most rediculous thing you've ever heard. Then, there is a chance that this thing could be dead and buried by 6th period.",4400
Dawson's Creek,1,5,Pacey,"I... I can do that. I can be cool. Casual. A smile, a little wink, and easy stride through the Home Ec. wing, Ya know, like, like nothing happened. Like I got not a care in the world.",4401

Cause Look at me here I am a C+ student, who sits in the back of Ms. Jacobs English class everyday, daydreaming about the same thing. About, what it would be like to be..... a little bit better looking, a little more sophisticated and about 15 years older. Cause, then and only then, could Ms. Jacobs possibly look at me as anything other than just another one of her students. And, only then, could this rumor stand any chance of being true. Ah, I mean, don't get me wrong, I am flattered with the seriousness that you took these allegations, but ya know personally I'd just chalked them up to adolescent fantasy. I kind of expected you guys to do the same.",4586

Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,Well it was a great privedeledge to be chosen by the showgun.,4772
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Grant,"So the showgun was like the school stud. Every chick wanted a piece of him, right?",4773
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,No they didn't want a piece of him.,4774

Dawson's Creek,1,6,Teacher,You disagree.,4841

Dawson's Creek,1,6,Teacher,Die with dignity? Is this a euphemism for m*rder and su1c1de?,4843
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"No. If they're in pain or if it's only a matter of time. I mean, don't you think there comes a point when life is no longer worth living?",4844

Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,Wooo. This may come as a shock to you but just because you're juiced up on steroids doesn't mean you can barge in line wherever you want you know people have been waiting and it's rude.,4857

Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"Hey now there's an idea, games. We could all play a game.",5004
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Really? What do you want to play? Pin the tail on the ho-bag, huh?",5005
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"We should play truth or dare. Please? I'll be your best friend. Okay, I'll go first. Dawson. You can ask me anything. I'll tell the truth.",5006
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,"Forget about it, Abby.",5007
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"Come on, Dawson. Isn't there anything you've ever wanted to ask me?",5008
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Yeah are you really an alien and what planet are you from?,5009
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"No and Earth. Okay, my turn.",5010
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Wait a minute.,5011
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"No, that was your question.",5012
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,That wasn't a question that was a joke.,5013
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,Look there are rules to this game and your turn is over now it's my turn. Okay....Pacey! Truth or dare Pacey?,5014
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Alright Abby. Just remember, I'm next.",5015
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"Oh, I'm so scared, truth or dare Pacey?",5016
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,Dare...truth...I don't care.,5017
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"Okay, truth. Pacey, why are you in detention?",5018
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Well, uh, it's just, uh, I want a dare.",5019
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"Oh come on Pacey, just tell us.",5020
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,Hey. I want a dare.,5021
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"You are such a wuss. Fine, dare. I dare you to kiss on the lips for",5022
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,10 seconds...Jen!,5023
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,What?,5024
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,We're waiting.,5025
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,This is stupid.,5026
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,Yeah nobody wants to play this game anyways.,5027
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"I do. And Pacey said dare, better do what she says.",5028
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,Fine. What do I care?,5029
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,*They kiss*,5030
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Okay, Joey, Miss ""you better do what she says"". What'll it be truth or dare?",5031
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"No, you said--",5032
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,Ah-ha-ha-ha. Truth or dare?,5033
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,Truth.,5034
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,Okay. Who do you like?,5035
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,Who do I like?,5036
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,Very simple. Who are you in love with? The truth.,5037
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,Did I say truth? I meant dare.,5038
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,You guys are such wimps. Can't any of you handle the truth?,5039
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,I'll do anything. I'll climb through the ventilation chaps or I'll go flash Mrs. Tringle.,5040
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Okay, perfect. Then in keeping with our kissing theme, Joey I dare you to kiss on the lips for 15 seconds, Dawson Leery.",5041
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,No. No way.,5042
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Pacey grow up!,5043
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"No, you have to do it, Joey.",5044
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,You did say you'd do anything.,5045
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"Fine. Dawson, c'mere.",5046
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,Go on.,5047
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,I'll keep the time.,5048
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,*They kiss.*,5049
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,13...14...15.,5050
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,*They stop.*,5051
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"So are we having fun yet? Your turn. Earth to dimwit. Come in, dimwit.",5052
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"Okay, Jen. Truth or dare?",5053
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,Truth.,5054
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"Out of all the guys at Capeside, is Dawson the one you're most attracted to?",5055
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,Is Dawson the one I like the best? Of course.,5056
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"No, I didn't ask you if he was the one you liked the best I asked if he was the one you're the most attracted to.",5057
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,What do you mean attracted to?,5058
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,She means attracted. Physically attracted.,5059
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"Is he the guy you're hottest for? I mean, when you look at Dawson do you want to just jump his bones? Or is it that you like his personality the best but in terms of lust you'd rather boink somebody else like Pacey.",5060
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"No, I like Dawson.",5061
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"Yeah, but do you lust for him?",5062
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,That's a stupid question.,5063
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Why is it a stupid question?,5064
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,I'm totally okay with this question.,5065
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"It's stupid because....it's stupid because...the answer is yes, obviously. I lust for Dawson. I'm hot for Dawson. Maybe if you spent less time...forget it.",5066
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"What? Come on, Jen, tell me, I can handle it. What do you have to say?",5067
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,Maybe if you spent less time dwelling on me and Dawson you might have a boyfriend of your own.,5068
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"Oh yeah, wouldn't that just be heaven on earth. To call one of these pigs at Capeside my boyfriend and be some perky cheerleader who gets pumped and dumped by the school jocks. Yeah, have s*x with Grant Bodine on the locker room floor. Wouldn't that be great?",5069
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,Just like a true lesbian (don't know if this phrase is right),5070
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,Yeah I wish I was a lesbian. And Jen I'm not dwelling on your relationship with Dawson so just get over yourself.,5071
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,"Okay, I dare all of us.",5072
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,To do what?,5073
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,"To follow me, it's time for a jail break.",5074
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,*They walk out and pass the doorway where Mrs. Tringle is watching soaps.*,5075
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,We're totally gonna get caught.,5076
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"Nope, we're not. Mrs. Tringle is in there watching Days of Our Lives which means she probably taped a week's worth of episodes which means she has an hour and a half left to go so we should have an hour of freedom.",5077
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,What exactly are we doing out here anyway?,5078
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"Well I suggest we play a new game. This one is a friendly, fun for the whole family, adventure called Guess My Butt.",5079
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,Guess My Butt?,5080
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,*CUT TO Pacey sitting on a copier making a copy of his naked butt.*,5081
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,That felt good.,5082
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"Okay, Pacey it's time to pull up your pants now. Okay, now it's time to play guess my butt.",5083
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,They all look the same.,5084
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"No, if you look closely they have subtle differences.",5085
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,This one is so perky and petite. It's got to be mine.,5086
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,And this one has got to be Pacey's!,5087
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,How do you know?,5088
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,I can just tell.,5089
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,Duh cause she's checked it out.,5090
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Don't make me ill.,5091
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Oh please, she can't help herself. My butt, really, it's like a magnet, chicks they just can't keep their eyes off.",5092
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,*The girls laugh.*,5093
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,"Stop man, you're pathetic.",5094
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,You're just jealous?,5095
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Of you? This is,5096
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Dawson, this is so blatant. That's why you threw the basketball at my nose and that's why you've been acting like such a puke.",5097
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Me? I've been acting like a puke?,5098
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"Dawson, don't get upset.",5099
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Hey, you're just jealous of me. You're jealous of me because I'm a better athlete. You're jealous of me because I've got a better s*x life.",5100
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,"Yeah, Pacey, you're a real Don Juan.",5101
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,At least my nickname was never Oompa Loompa.,5102
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,The reality of it Pacey is that you're not good at anything. You are a total failure not to mention the laughing stock of the entire school.,5103
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"Come on guys, stop.",5104
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,Can't we all just get along?,5105
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"You know, I never knew what it did to a man's ego to lose a basketball game.",5106
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,I didn't lose that game.,5107
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,Do you want a rematch?,5108
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,"I'll wup you anytime, anywhere.",5109
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,*CUT TO gymnasium.*,5110
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,Why are you doing this?,5111
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,I'm not going to let him toss his rocks off (?) at my expense. The guy has s*x one time and he thinks he's Will Chambers.,5112
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,That's what it's about? s*x?,5113
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,No. But you know it is a little humiliating. I'm the one with the girlfriend and he's giving me s*x tips.,5114
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"Dawson this is stupid, you don't have to do this.",5115
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,*Joey and Abby are walking on the bleachers.*,5116
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"Hmm, this should be interesting.",5117
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Alright, Oompa Loompa. This is your moment of truth.",5118
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,If I win you have to tell us all why you're in detention.,5119
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Me? Lose this? Come on, stay off the crack, pal. Come on.",5120
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,*They start playing.*,5121
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,Pacey you're supposed to get it in the net. My dog plays basketball better than you two.,5122
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"This is ridiculous. I mean, why do guys feel the need to compete over everything?",5123
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"Oh yeah, us sisters never compete over anything. Dawson, nice airball.",5124
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,Don't you think you should go get some pom-pons Jen? Cheer your man on.,5125
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"Alright Joey, I give up, you win. I keep trying to get you to like me but there's nothing I can do is there?",5126
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,What do you mean? Whatever. I like you.,5127
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"Come on, Joey, I'm not a fool. All your little catty comments are not lost on me. I mean, what did I ever do to you? All I've ever done is try to be your friend.",5128
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"You all can never be friends as long as you keep fighting over the same guy. Joey, it's obvious you're in love with Dawson.",5129
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,You're wrong.,5130
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"I saw a kiss that could set the atlantic ocean on fire. Don't tell me I'm wrong about these things. That kiss was intense. Well, I can see you guys have a lot to talk about. I'm parched. I'm going to get some water.",5131
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,Joey I know this has got to be kind of--,5132
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"Look, I don't want to talk about it. With you.",5133
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,I know. It's okay. I understand.,5134
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,Why do you have to be like this?,5135
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,Like what?,5136
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"So nice. God. It would be so much easier if you were just a total wench, that's all.",5137
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"Well, I guess I could try to be more of a wench.",5138
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,*Joey gives her a look.*,5139
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,*CUT TO Abby looking up at a clock.*,5140
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,Guys! We've got to get back to the library right now!,5141
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,No way.,5142
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,*Dawson makes a basket*,5143
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Yes!,5144
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,That's not fair!,5145
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"Guys, seriously, if we don't get our xeroxed butts back to the library in the next two minutes we're doomed!",5146
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Girls, yo, locker room's quicker.",5147
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,*They run down the halls and see Mrs. Tringle waiting for them.*,5148
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,Hey Mrs. Tringle. How's in hangin'?,5149
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,*CUT TO library.*,5150
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Mrs. Tringle,Is there any reason why I shouldn't give you all detention next Saturday?,5151
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,Yes. We were starving. Mrs. Tringle you can't keep us locked up here in this library with no food. I am a member of Amnesty International.,5152
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Mrs. Tringle,So you went to the gym to what? Eat a basketball?,5153
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,No. We didn't know what we were doing. We were delirious.,5154
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Mrs. Tringle,Abby if I hear one more peep out of you...,5155
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,Mrs.--,5156
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,*Pacey covers her mouth.*,5157
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Mrs. Tringle,These cards need sorting.,5158
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Mrs. Tringle,*SHe dumps them out.*,5159
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Mrs. Tringle,You will spend the rest of the afternoon arranging the cards alphabetically. If even one card is out of order you all will spend next Saturday here with me in detention. Are you hip to my lingo?,5160
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Mrs. Tringle,"*She leaves and Pacey, Jen, Joey, and Dawson start picking up the cards.*",5161
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Abby are you going to help or not?,5162
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"Oh, I can't. I have carpal tunnel syndrome.",5163
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,*time lapse. Joey hands Pacey her cards and Pacey takes them to Dawson.*,5164
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Ohh. Last one.,5165
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,Thank God.,5166
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,*Mrs. Tringle walks in.*,5167
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Mrs. Tringle,How are those cards coming?,5168
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"Oh, good. We have them finished Mrs. Tringle.",5169
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Mrs. Tringle,It's 4:30. You should all be able to go home soon.,5170
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,Mrs. Tringle. Oh you have such pretty eyes. Have you ever thought about contacts?,5171
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Mrs. Tringle,"Abby, you don't have to flatter me. You've served your time in detention. Hopefully you've learned something. Excessive tardies will not be tolerated here at Capeside.",5172
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Mrs. Tringle,*She leaves.*,5173
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Excessive tardies?,5174
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,What happened to the ecstasy Abby?,5175
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,And the orgy on the floor of the boy's locker room?,5176
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,I knew this from the very beginning. I saw through your school slut routine. You're a liar.,5177
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,Takes one to know one.,5178
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Oh, please. Spare me. You're nothing but a white-bred, country club goody-two-shoes with a bad case of potty mouth.",5179
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,Oh no. Pacey's onto me. I can never show my face in public again. Big deal. I was just trying to make the day more interesting. The question is why are you in detention?,5180
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,"Yeah, that was the deal remember? If you lost the game you'd have to tell us why you are in detention.",5181
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,That game was a sham.,5182
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,A deal's a deal.,5183
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen and Joey,"Come on, Pacey.",5184
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,You know what? It's just not going to happen okay?,5185
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Can't expect Pacey to 'fess up to anything.,5186
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,I am so sick and tired of you copping this attitude with me.,5187
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,"I want to trust you, Pacey.",5188
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,You want to trust me? Like I'm going to steal your girlfriend or something.,5189
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,I wouldn't put it past you. You'd do anything for s*x.,5190
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"That sucks, Dawson. Is that the way you feel about me?",5191
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,What am I supposed to think? You kissed my girlfriend!,5192
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,It was a dare!,5193
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,Thank you.,5194
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,You guys were totally into it.,5195
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"Well, I wasn't. No offense.",5196
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,None taken.,5197
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,That whole Oompa-Loompa thing.,5198
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Oh, for the love of God, Dawson. You've blown that thing way out of proportion.",5199
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,"Maybe I have, alright? But you don't understand. You don't get it. Those two words, Oompa Loompa. I HATE those words. It's like every insecurity I have about myself exists inside those two words. And when you call me that it's like you're exposing me for not being Mr. Varsity Athlete. For not being sexually experienced. I'm a virgin alright? I'm not some s*x stud like you.",5200
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"s*x stud? Please tell me you're joking Dawson. Okay, do you want to know why I'm in here?",5201
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Yeah.,5202
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,You all have to swear that this never leaves this room.,5203

Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,I swear. *then when pacey turns away she crosses her fingers.*,5207
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Okay. Yesterday, after you totally busted up my nose with that basketball, the cheerleaders were being really friendly towards me. Bandaging up my nose, and hugging me and stuff. I got a little excited.",5208
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,Oh no.,5209
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"I went in the bathroom to, uh, relieve the tension.",5210
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,Oh my God...,5211
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,Yeah and the coach came in and wanted to check up on my nose...,5212
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,"He saw a lot more than just your nose, didn't he?",5213
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Yeah, well, needless to say that's why I'm here.",5214
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,That's the most embarressing story I've ever heard.,5215
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Thanks. So do you think you can stop throwing basketballs at my face now, Dawson? I think it's glaringly obvious that I'm not going to steal your girlfriend. I mean, at least you have a girlfriend. I've got nothing left.",5216
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Abby,You have your hand.,5217
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,You're right. I've been taking my frustrations out on you. I guess I'm just looking for a reason why....,5218
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,What? Why what?,5219
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Why you don't want me.,5220
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,Hey Dawson. I like you.,5221
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Yeah but it's not enough that you like me. I want you to want me.,5222
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,"You're like a God to me Dawson, and I don't even believe in God. I mean, this school hasn't exactly welcomed me with open arms. It seems like everybody here hates me and I don't know why. If it's because I'm from New York, or because I'm different. It seems like my life here is just one big detention that I can't escape, but then, I think about you. And about how I've met a guy who's so romantic, and so caring, and who I like, and who I want so much. Dawson it's because of you that I get through the bad days. And if you think I want you to be some big, varsity s*x stud then you're crazy.",5223
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,"I understand that you want to take things slow, I do. And I don't want to rush you. I don't want to be that guy. But I'm human, I have hormones. And to say that I've never thought about having s*x with you, I'd be lying. The thought crosses my mind. About a thousand times a day.",5224
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Jen,Well just a thousand? That's nothing.,5225
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,"Pacey, I've been a real jerk. I'm really sorry about your nose, man.",5226
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"I'm sorry I called you Oompa Loompa, man. It shouldn't come as much of as surprise. Considering I'm such a screw-up.",5227
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,You're not a screw-up.,5228
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"Yeah, I am a screw-up and everybody knows it.",5229
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,*Abby nods.*,5230
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Pacey,"But Dawson, you're my best friend, man. I don't want to screw that up.",5231
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"You know when did everyone because so obsessed with s*x? Now, you too, Dawson. If you're worried that everyone's more experienced than you, you can rest easy because you still have one friend who will probably go to her grave a virgin.",5232
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Joey it's just a matter of time.,5233
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,Until what? My brain short circuits and I start bedding down with every guy with a fast car and big biceps?,5234
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Before you find the right person.,5235
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,I have.,5236
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,Joey?,5237
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"I'm sorry Dawson. I don't know what's going on. I have all these feelings. These weird feelings. And I don't know how to say it and I can't say it. I mean, you know everything about me, everything. And I still can't say this. I can't. And I just feel really lonely.",5238
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,You're not alone.,5239
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,Yes I am.,5240
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Dawson,"Jo, I'm here for you now, okay? Nothing you can say is going to change that. Maybe if you just say these things then they'll be out in the open and your feelings won't be as strong anymore. Like you could be free.",5241
Dawson's Creek,1,6,Joey,"I can't. I can't. If I say these things, I can't ever take them back. It'll change everything and I can't do that. I can't.",5242

Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,"You know what, Jen? That's impossible, ok? Because I don't have a ex-girl-friend. You're my girlfriend, my first and only. All I'm trying to do is prevent Billy's ex from becoming my ex too.",5478

Dawson's Creek,1,7,Joey,"No, because it was on cable last night and it put the baby to sleep. In fact, it's the only thing that's put baby to sleep, because baby never sleeps. And if baby doesn't sleep, I don't sleep. If I don't sleep, I get angry. I get irritable and I can no longer maintain my sunny deposition. So, Pacey, if you even have the slightest bit of human decency, you'd rent this movie to me immediately and bring a 181 minutes of peace into my otherwise wretched life. Please?",5485

Dawson's Creek,1,7,Pacey,"Ohh, Dawson, my fine oblivious friend. One of thse days, you're gonna have to take a gigantic fact check, my friend, alright? She didn't mistake you for anybody, okay? This girl is head in the clouds, 100% ass-backwards in love with you, alright?",5715
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,"Dude, Pacey. Joey and I have a great time together, and it's great to have someone you know so well that you don't even have to verbalize what you're thinking, most of the time. The other person just gets it, picks up on it, and I, it, it's like that with Joey and me. it's great. And...And I like it but it... it's not love.",5716
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Pacey,"Allright. Don't you think it's a little strange that in the middle of a disastrous weekend with your girlfriend Jen, you and I are sitting here talking about your ""friend"" Joey?",5717
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,"Love is what I have with Jen. Okay? It's exciting, it's it's new and unknown. It...yeah, sometimes it's outta hand but trust me, there's a difference between friendship and love.",5718
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Pacey,Right and you're so sure that you know the difference?,5719
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,"You, you don't know what you're talking about.",5720
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Stage directions,(Billy is getting ready to leave when Dawson comes into his room.),5721
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,Leaving so soon?,5722
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Billy,"Yeah, thought I'd check out the scenery up the coast. My travel agent says the leaves are spectacular this time of year.",5723
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,I assume you haven't tried to steal anything. Other than my girlfriend.,5724
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Billy,"Hey, relax, alright. You win. I just talked to Jen and apparently she's not as confused as she seems. So, it looks like the nice guy gets the girl after all.",5725
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Stage directions,"(Billy gets his luggage and leaves, then turns around.)",5726
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Billy,"Oh, by the way, if traffic's with me, I can make it up here from New York in under three and an half hours. You better treat her good,Dawson.",5727
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,I will.,5728
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Stage directions,(Billy leaves.  Dawson looks at the window and sees Jen at the pier.  He goes out to join her.),5729
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,"(putting his arms around her) You know for someone who views themselves as a tragically nice guy, I spend an awful lot of time apologizing. Jen, I'm sorry about what I said earlier. Insecurity brings out the worst.",5730
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Stage directions,(Jen pulls away from him and stands on the other side of the pier.),5731
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Jen,"You know how you're always curious about how my life was like in New York? Truth is, it's really no different than it is right now. I mean, geography aside, I am still the same stupid girl who's always found it easier to escape into a relationship than to face life on her own.",5732
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,"Jen, that's not true, okay? It's this whole Billy thing. Now that the ghost of boyfriend's past is gone, we can go back.",5733
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Jen,"To what? Dawson, I'm sixteen, I've, I've never stayed home on a Saturday night. I've never gone stag to a school dance. I mean, I'm pretty, I'm lucky, I'm fortunate and I am still way too unhappy most of the time. I told Billy today that it was over with us.",5734
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,I know. He told me,5735
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Jen,And now I have to say the same thing to you.,5736
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,(surprised) What? Jen?,5737
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Jen,"I know I criticize you for living in a fantasy world, Dawson, but the truth is, I envy you. Everything's so new, so untouched for you. i would gladly trade in all my experiences for just an ounce of your idealism. And I wish I knew some better way to say this but.",5738
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,"Yeah, but we can make it work. We can fix this.",5739
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Jen,No!,5740
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,"I know we can. We can. You know, sleep on this. We'll talk in the morning. We don't need to go over this now.",5741
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Jen,"Dawson, please. Listen to me. I've got to take a few steps back. I've, I've got to try life on my own for awhile.",5742
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,(upset) You can't just make me fall for you and then bail as soon as. I can't.,5743
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Jen,"I'll miss you, you know.",5744
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Stage directions,(Dawson turns around.),5745
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,Yeah.,5746
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Jen,"I'll be sleeping 80 feet away from you and it will feel like a thousand miles. I'll regret my decision constantly. I'll kick myself to no end and when I come crawling back to you, you'll have every right to say 'take a hike, Jen, I'm with somebody else now'.",5747
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Dawson,"Somebody who appreciates me. Somebody who doesn't blow into town with her dysfunctional past and play mind games with the boy next door. Somebody who is capable of a healthy, committed relationship and unfortunately, somebody nothing like you.",5748
Dawson's Creek,1,7,Stage directions,"(Dawson walks up the pier, turns around, then continues.  Jen watches him go home.)",5749
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Dawson, Neighbor girl dumped you. No one died. Just get over it.",5750
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,It was 48 hours ago. And you'd think I exceeded the statue of limitations of pain.,5751
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"It's not a matter of time, Dawson, it's a matter of degree. You haven't eaten and you stare at Jen's house like it's going to disappear. And I've seen you at school. You spy. It's twisted. And I'm almost afraid to ask what movie you brought back tonight.",5752
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Sid and Nancy.,5753
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"See, your problem is that you're getting off on this.",5754
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"*getting up from the window and going to his desk* Sorry, Joey.*Picks up ET doll* It's tough to come up with creative moping strategies once I realized that everything I'm about is exactly what turned her off. It's not like I can learn to dance or get a new haircut or something.",5755
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"*gets up from the bed and goes over to her* Dawson, she dumped you, not your belief system.",5756
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"She rejected romance, honesty, and respect. Everytime I see Billy outside of her house, I'm reminded.",5757
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,Everything reminds you of her.,5758
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Oh?,5759
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Dawson, you've known the girl for three months. How could everything possibly remind you of her?",5760
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"I don't know, Joey, I can't explain it. It just does.",5761
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,*Dawson goes over to his bed and lays down. Joey follows and grabs the remote from him. She sits down on the chair next to the bed*,5762
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"C'mon, let's just watch the movie. This conversation is becoming far too disturbing.",5763
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,*Dawson looks at the tv and sees Jen's face. He grabs a pillow and puts it over his face.*,5764
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Ohhhhhhhhh.,5765
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Theme Song to Dawson's Creek,5766
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"*Billy climbs up Jen's window and into her room. He looks around it, picking up pictures here and there, and finally lays on her bed to wait for her*",5767
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"*voice heard* Hey. Grams, have you seen my green shirt? I, I think it needs ironing.",5768
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Grams,"*voice* Oh yes, dear. I thought I saw it in your closet. *Grams enters* Ah, you left it on the dresser. *looks over and sees Billy on the bed*Jennifer, would you come up here now, please? And bring the telephone *To Billy* And you would be?",5769
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Quite comfortable, thanks.",5770
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Grams,I want a name.,5771
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,Billy.,5772
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Grams,"Billy? Oh yes, I've heards about you before.",5773
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"*entering her room* Okay, I've got the phone. *sees Billy* What the hell are you doing here?",5774
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Word is, you dropped Dawson, so I just thought you might be looking for a suitable replacement.",5775
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Grams,"If he's not out of my house in two minutes, I'm calling the National Guard.*to Jen* And then I would like a serious word with you.",5776
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Grams,*Grams leaves*,5777
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,*calling after her* Great to meet you.,5778
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,I thought you were leaving.,5779
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"You know, my car was packed and I really was, Jenny, but then word trickled down and I thought it might be in my best interest to stick around a little longer.",5780
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"Well then, why don't I clearify things for you. Just because Dawson and I are on hiatus doesn't mean there's some vacancy I'm looking to fill.",5781
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,Let's just say there happened to be this guy. Some guy you had an intense connection with. Then I might think you'd be open to the possibility.,5782
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,I'd have to say no. But I'd also like to add: not a chance and never again.,5783
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"You used to be fun, you know that.",5784
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"No, I used to be weak and vulnerable.",5785
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Yeah, well next time you alter your personality, let me know in advance. It'll save me in gas money. *Billy exits through the window*",5786
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,*Billy is sitting outside on the hood of his car eating an apple. Dawson walks by on his way to class*,5787
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"You know, I'm beginning to doubt your sincerity when you tell me you're leaving.",5788
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"*getting off his car* Hey, just the man I was looking for.",5789
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"What can I provide you with this time, Billy? A place to stay? Or just another chance to completely screw up my life?",5790
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"You know, despite outword appearances, you and I actually have a lot in common.",5791
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Right. Both got our hearts broken by the same girl. But you know what? Jen didn't flee the state to get away from me.,5792
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,Give her time.,5793
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,*Dawson starts walking away from Billy*,5794
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Man, if I lived 50 yards away from her, I swear to you, I'd go insane.",5795
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,*Dawson stops to listen to Billy*,5796
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Stare up at her window wondering what she's doing. She's talking on the phone, who is she talking to? And if she's listening to music, who do those songs remind her of? Does she still think about me?",5797
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,And does she think about me as half as much as I think of her.,5798
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,See what I mean. Common ground. But the good news is there's a simple cure for all of this.,5799
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,*Dawson walks back to Billy to hear more*,5800
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Yeah?,5801
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Yeah. Don't get me wrong. Jen is a great girl. But last time I checked, she wasn't the only one. What? Are you unconvinced? Look, take a little ride with me. Let me illustrate my point.",5802
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Take a ride where?,5803
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Providence. There's this club there. It's a bit of a dive but absolutely remarkable in one respect. It lies exactly equi-distant between a pair of women's colleges. Co-eds wall-to-wall, Dawson.",5804
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Can I get in? I'm not exactly legal.,5805
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,I know the bouncer.,5806
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Of course, there's school.",5807
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,And what's waiting for you there? Another day wondering about Jenny? Where she is? When you'll see her next? What football player she's having lunch with?,5808
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"You made your point. And you know what? You're right. This is exactly what I need. To get away from her. To get away from here. You know what, she's going to freak when I'm not there. It'll be good to let her wonder about me for awhile.",5809
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,*Billy and Dawson drive off together*,5810
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,*Joey is walking down the middle of the street to school. Warren Gerry is driving along in his jeep. He continues driving even as they talk*,5811
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"Hey, Warren Gerry. I'm on my way to school. You need a lift?",5812
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Ah, no thanks. I'm waiting for Ted Bundy.",5813
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"Well, Ted's a lucky man.",5814
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,Ted Bundy is dead. He was a serial--,5815
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"k*ller. Yeah, I know. Executed in Florida, claimed p*rn made him do it. So come on, what do you say? I need the merit badge.",5816
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,And which badge is that?,5817
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,Community Service. I'm going to say you were 80 and blind.,5818
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Well, I'm sure you'll be an Eagle Scout by the end of the day.",5819
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"Exactly. So what do you say? C'mon, help me out here.",5820
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,*Joey relents and she gets in the car with him. They are soon driving to school together*,5821
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,So is the air cold or are you just happy to see me?,5822
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,You had to go and do it. You had to invoke my participation. Does it bother you that you singlehandly participated the stereotype?,5823
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,Which answer means we can get friendly down in the sand together?,5824
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"You know. if having s*x ruined it, and famine didn't even work, and kissing you would bring out a new AIDs enlightenment, then I'd...",5825
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"You know something? You talk a lot. So what? That's all you and your boyfriend*Joey looks at him* Dawson, and I use the term loosely, do? Talk?",5826
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"You don't need to use the term at all, Warren. Dawson is not my boyfriend.",5827
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"Well, the boy part I was reffering to.",5828
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,*Joey looks at him strangely*,5829
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,What? You ever seen the guy throw a baseball?,5830
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Believe it or not, there's no correlation between a slide and a sperm count.",5831
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"How would you know? I mean, you're obviously a virgin.",5832
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"How do you know that Dawson and I haven't been going at it for years? I mean, we could be imitating the Kuma Sutra for all you know.",5833
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,Oh.,5834
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"You know, I might be a virgin, but believe me, it's by choice.",5835
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,*Joey and Warren continue driving to school*,5836
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,*Dawson and Billy are in the hallway of the school. Dawson spots Pacey and starts to go over to him*,5837
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,You could have waited in the car.,5838
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Don't worry, I won't tell anyone we're together.",5839
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,"*as Billy leaves them* Hey, what's he up to?",5840
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,We're cutting out of here. We're going up to a club in Providence.,5841
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,Finally! Dawson's evil twin. This is going to be a much anticipated pleasure.,5842
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,*Pacey shuts his locker preparing to go with Dawson*,5843
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,What are you doing?,5844
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,"You're cutting class to go to a nightclub, you're asking what I'm doing. I'm coming with you,man. I wouldn't miss this for the world.",5845
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Billy.,5846
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,Hey. Great so we're ready to go?,5847
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Yeah. I'm going to go turn in my math homework and we're out of here.,5848
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,*Dawson rushes off*,5849
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,Yeah. Walk on the wild side.,5850
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,*Joey and Jen are walking towards their lockers with each other*,5851
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"*to Joey* Listen, I heard something this morning that I thought you should. *Jen spots Billy by her locker*",5852
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"At the risk of sounding redundant, what the hell are you doing here?",5853
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,The boys just have to wrap up some things before we left. *to Joey* Good morning.,5854
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,What are you talking about?,5855
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"I'm taking Pacey and your boy here on a little road trip. Funny, but in the midst of all the confusion, Dawson and I actually stumbled upon some common ground.",5856
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"I don't think I like the sound of this, Billy. The last thing Dawson needs is to be pulled down by you.",5857
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"I swear to you, Dawson was simply complaining how a guy can't seem to get any around here. So, I told him about this little place I know.",5858
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,What kind of place?,5859
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,Let's just say that women take cash and are remarkably friendly.,5860
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,You're taking him to a whore house?,5861
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"*spying Dawson* Oh, there's his holiness now. Well girls, gotta run. I see Saint Dawson is chumping at the bits to get some.",5862
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,I think I'm going to go barf.,5863
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,*They leave the girls*,5864
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,Excuse me *pulling Pacey with him*,5865
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,We're not really going to go..,5866
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,No. I was just kidding around.,5867
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,Oh?,5868
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Cheer up, stud.",5869
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,*Jen and Joey are back at their lockers talking*,5870
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,God.,5871
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"You know, I've never really had a whole lot of faith in guys. But I. I thought Dawson was different.",5872
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Yeah, he's different. Unfortunately, he's just not as different as we thought.",5873
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"No. Listen, ah, Joey, you know that football player Warren.",5874
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,What?,5875
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"You didn't sleep with him, did you?",5876
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Yeah, I had s*x with Warren Gerry. Right after I gave a sponge bath to the Navy pilots. Why would you even ask me that?",5877
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,He's telling everyone you did.,5878
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,*Jen and Joey are left standing in the hall as the bell rings signaling class*,5879
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"*Dawson, Billy and Pacey are on the ferry to get to Rhode Island. Billy is down below the deck and Pacey and Dawson are talking by the rails.*",5880
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,I'm going to go downstairs and get a drink.,5881
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Alright. We'll be right here.,5882
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,"Alright, one more time. Dawson, you're not the type of guy who does something bad just because it feels good.",5883
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Oh, there's a oxymoron to live by.",5884
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,"What? You want examples of this? Alright, what's the first thing, the very first thing you did after announcing this little roadtrip of ours? Remember? You know exactly what it was, don't you? You turned in your Math homework. Man, hey, those are not exactly the actions of a rebel. But there's nothing wrong with that. You just cared about what people think about you. You're that nice Leery boy, man. You like being the nice Leery boy.",5885
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Oh yeah, and you're any different?",5886
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,"Hey.Please. Just, you know, talk to the school board and take a glance at my permanent records. There's not comparision between you and I, Dawson. Everybody knows you're a regular Richie Cunningham. Billy, he's the Fonz.",5887
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Congratulations. That makes you Potsie.,5888
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,*The school lunchroom. Jen is sitting at a table with some people. Joey walks up to Warren who's sitting with his football friends*,5889
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,We need to talk.,5890
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,She needs to talk.,5891
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,*Warren gets up from his table and follows her to a corner of the room*,5892
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"It wasn't very memorable, Warren.",5893
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,What?,5894
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"The s*x. In fact, I can't seem to remember it at all. Why don't you refresh my memory?",5895
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,It was actually pretty good. Although you did eventually complain of fatigue.,5896
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,What is going on in that twisted head of yours?,5897
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"Look, this could be a win-win.",5898
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,Explain.,5899
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"Our reps. Okay, I've got one to live up to; you have one to live down.",5900
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,What? And people thinking we're doing the deed is going to help my precious reputation?,5901
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"Well, you know how in baseball, there are major and minor leagues?",5902
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,Yeah.,5903
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"Well, think of this as your call up to the show. No more shying in flyballs with washouts and wannabes.",5904
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"You are such a b*st*rd. If you're the major leagues, well, then I hope I never get out of the A-ball.",5905
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"*loud enough for everyone to hear*Hey look, I never said that I would be your boyfriend.",5906
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,*Everyone looks at them. Joey storms off upset and Jen follows to make sure she's okay*,5907
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,*Jen finds Joey hunched on the stairs in the hallway. Jen stands at the foot of the stairs leaning against the wall*,5908
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,I never believed it.,5909
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,You sure? That's why you asked.,5910
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"I only asked because I was concerned, Joey. But I would have bet anything against it. Besides.",5911
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,Besides what?,5912
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"Nevermind. I guess I've always just pictured you with someone different. Someone. You know, just another lifeform.",5913
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,Walking upright.,5914
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,Yeah. Opposible thumb. The whole bit. And maybe someone just a tad more sensitive than Warren.,5915
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Yeah, well, in my experiences, even the sensitive ones can let you down with the best of them.",5916
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"You know, Joey, maybe Dawson is.",5917
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Look, I didn't say a thing about Dawson. And as far as Warren and his pathetic fantasies go, you know, what harm can a guy do? I mean, being called a football groupie could describe half the girls in this school.",5918
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"Joey, I may be overstepping my boundaries here, but, ah, I think I know a way to get Warren back.",5919
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,What? You know how to make a voodoo doll or something?,5920
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"No, I'm serious. You know, guys like Warren have been getting away with this kind of stuff way too long. So, what do you say Joey? Are you interested in a little payback?",5921

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,It was 48 hours ago. And you'd think I exceeded the statue of limitations of pain.,5932
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"It's not a matter of time, Dawson, it's a matter of degree. You haven't eaten and you stare at Jen's house like it's going to disappear. And I've seen you at school. You spy. It's twisted. And I'm almost afraid to ask what movie you brought back tonight.",5933

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"(getting up from the window and going to his desk) Sorry, Joey.(Picks up ET doll) It's tough to come up with creative moping strategies once I realized that everything I'm about is exactly what turned her off. It's not like I can learn to dance or get a new haircut or something.",5936
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"(gets up from the bed and goes over to her) Dawson, she dumped you, not your belief system.",5937

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Oh?,5940
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Dawson, you've known the girl for three months. How could everything possibly remind you of her?",5941

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Word is, you dropped Dawson, so I just thought you might be looking for a suitable replacement.",5957

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"You know, my car was packed and I really was, Jenny, but then word trickled down and I thought it might be in my best interest to stick around a little longer.",5962
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"Well then, why don't I clearify things for you. Just because Dawson and I are on hiatus doesn't mean there's some vacancy I'm looking to fill.",5963
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,Let's just say there happened to be this guy. Some guy you had an intense connection with. Then I might think you'd be open to the possibility.,5964
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,I'd have to say no. But I'd also like to add: not a chance and never again.,5965
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"You used to be fun, you know that.",5966
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"No, I used to be weak and vulnerable.",5967

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"(getting off his car) Hey, just the man I was looking for.",5971
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"What can I provide you with this time, Billy? A place to stay? Or just another chance to completely screw up my life?",5972
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"You know, despite outword appearances, you and I actually have a lot in common.",5973
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Right. Both got our hearts broken by the same girl. But you know what? Jen didn't flee the state to get away from me.,5974
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,Give her time.,5975
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Stage directions,(Dawson starts walking away from Billy),5976

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Stage directions,(Dawson stops to listen to Billy),5978
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Stare up at her window wondering what she's doing. She's talking on the phone, who is she talking to? And if she's listening to music, who do those songs remind her of? Does she still think about me?",5979
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,And does she think about me as half as much as I think of her.,5980
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,See what I mean. Common ground. But the good news is there's a simple cure for all of this.,5981
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Stage directions,(Dawson walks back to Billy to hear more),5982
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Yeah?,5983
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Yeah. Don't get me wrong. Jen is a great girl. But last time I checked, she wasn't the only one. What? Are you unconvinced? Look, take a little ride with me. Let me illustrate my point.",5984
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Take a ride where?,5985
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Providence. There's this club there. It's a bit of a dive but absolutely remarkable in one respect. It lies exactly equi-distant between a pair of women's colleges. Co-eds wall-to-wall, Dawson.",5986
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Can I get in? I'm not exactly legal.,5987
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,I know the bouncer.,5988
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Of course, there's school.",5989
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,And what's waiting for you there? Another day wondering about Jenny? Where she is? When you'll see her next? What football player she's having lunch with?,5990
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"You made your point. And you know what? You're right. This is exactly what I need. To get away from her. To get away from here. You know what, she's going to freak when I'm not there. It'll be good to let her wonder about me for awhile.",5991

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,So is the air cold or are you just happy to see me?,6004
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,You had to go and do it. You had to invoke my participation. Does it bother you that you singlehandly participated the stereotype?,6005
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,Which answer means we can get friendly down in the sand together?,6006
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"You know. if having s*x ruined it, and famine didn't even work, and kissing you would bring out a new AIDs enlightenment, then I'd",6007
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"You know something? You talk a lot. So what? That's all you and your boyfriend(Joey looks at him) Dawson, and I use the term loosely, do? Talk?",6008
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"You don't need to use the term at all, Warren. Dawson is not my boyfriend.",6009

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Stage directions,(Joey looks at him strangely),6011
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,What? You ever seen the guy throw a baseball?,6012
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Believe it or not, there's no correlation between a slide and a sperm count.",6013
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"How would you know? I mean, you're obviously a virgin.",6014
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"How do you know that Dawson and I haven't been going at it for years? I mean, we could be imitating the Kuma Sutra for all you know.",6015
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,Oh.,6016

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Billy.,6028
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,Hey. Great so we're ready to go?,6029
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Yeah. I'm going to go turn in my math homework and we're out of here.,6030

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,What are you talking about?,6038

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"I don't think I like the sound of this, Billy. The last thing Dawson needs is to be pulled down by you.",6040
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"I swear to you, Dawson was simply complaining how a guy can't seem to get any around here. So, I told him about this little place I know.",6041
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,What kind of place?,6042
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,Let's just say that women take cash and are remarkably friendly.,6043
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,You're taking him to a whore house?,6044
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"(spying Dawson) Oh, there's his holiness now. Well girls, gotta run. I see Saint Dawson is chumping at the bits to get some.",6045

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Oh, there's a oxymoron to live by.",6067
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,"What? You want examples of this? Alright, what's the first thing, the very first thing you did after announcing this little roadtrip of ours? Remember? You know exactly what it was, don't you? You turned in your Math homework. Man, hey, those are not exactly the actions of a rebel. But there's nothing wrong with that. You just cared about what people think about you. You're that nice Leery boy, man. You like being the nice Leery boy.",6068
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Oh yeah, and you're any different?",6069
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,"Hey.Please. Just, you know, talk to the school board and take a glance at my permanent records. There's not comparision between you and I, Dawson. Everybody knows you're a regular Richie Cunningham. Billy, he's the Fonz.",6070

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,Walking upright,6097
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,Yeah. Opposible thumb. The whole bit. And maybe someone just a tad more sensitive than Warren.,6098
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Yeah, well, in my experiences, even the sensitive ones can let you down with the best of them.",6099
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"You know, Joey,maybe Dawson is.",6100
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Look, I didn't say a thing about Dawson. And as far as Warren and his pathetic fantasies go,you know, what harm can a guy do? I mean,being called a football groupie could describe half the girls in this school.",6101

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,What? You know how to make a voodoo doll or something?,6103

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,"The year that you and I became into high school, Dawson.Okay, you're just going to have to trust me on this on. Sometimes, friendship means taking part in stupid stuff. No judgement. No questions asked. And no deconstruction of the event.",6119
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,You don't think I'm capable of that?,6120
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,Let's just say that I've seen no evidence to the contrary.,6121

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,"Well, what do you say that we give them some instant karma. Huh? Maybe uh, an iron on the tailpipe.",6126
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,I was thinking maybe we could just slash their tires or something.,6127
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Oh,that's imaginative.",6128

Look I, I, actually thought about sending over a drink, or saying something clever, what's your sign. I just figured that direct would be the best approach, ie, my name is Dawson. Not that my name of itself should impress you but in the hopes that you might respond and tell me your name.",6201
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Nina,Did it occur to you that maybe I'm just not interested?,6202
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Ahh,no. Blind optimism is one of my faults.",6203
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Nina,One of your faults? You have many?,6204
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Let's see, there's my reckless taste of disregard for danger, my tiredism romanticism, and of course, there's the way I keep on talking even when the person I'm trying to impress has lost all hope.",6205

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,What? What do you mean?,6226
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,You don't care about me. You're just looking for some convenient revenge scenerio to dump all your recedual male anger. Is that what Dawson was for you? Just some patsy to take a fall for all the guys who treated you bad?,6227
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"Don't Joey. Alright, don't. Don't turn this into a Dawson thing.",6228
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"You know, the real question was why I listened to you in the first place. I mean, Dawson was probably the first decent guy you ever gone out with and look what you did. You drove him right into the arms of a prostitute.",6229

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Nina,"Dawson, are we doing something you don't want to do? Because you're giving a pretty convincing Rain Man. Look, all we're doing is walking to my car.",6250
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,And after that?,6251
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Nina,"Well after that, I'm going home. You're the first person who's treated me right. I'm not in the habit of being the sexual facilitator.",6252
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,It's not like that.,6253
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Nina,"Come on, I saw your friend over your shoulder. They did everything but hold up score cards.",6254
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Maybe, Maybe it is something like that. I just got dumped.",6255
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Nina,Now it snaps into place.,6256
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,My friends thought the best way to get over her was,6257
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Nina,To nail a stranger.,6258
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,Yeah,6259
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Nina,I guessed. It's not exactly hard.,6260
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Sorry. But it did quit being about that. I spent an hour talking to you and I forgot all about it, about her. And for the first time in three days, I don't feel so bad.",6261
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Nina,"So, umm, would it impress your friends if you didn't leave here until morning?",6262
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,I think they'd wreck a statue.,6263
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Nina,"Hey, tell you what, why don't you come over. Fall asleep watching tv. I mean, you're a Speilberg fan. It's not like I'm in any danger, right? Hurry up, come on before I start listening to that little voice inside my head telling me I should card you.",6264
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,That girl I told you about? I still sort of want her back. Maybe I'm just being really crazy here. I just don't think it would be right.,6265
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Nina,I can't decide if I'm offended or if you just restored my faith in the male s*x.,6266

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,What do you mean? I thought she was.,6272
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Abby,"No, she isn't. That girl's comic relief. Speaking of which, Warren Gerry was called into the nurse's office this afternoon for a lecture on contraception.",6273
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"Well, good. He could use it.",6274
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Abby,"You don't get it. Warren is the last person who needs that lecture. What you heard was a lie made up by a pathetic sophomore trying to land a popular boyfriend. Besides, Warren couldn't fertilize a garden.",6275
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,What do you mean?,6276
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Abby,I had a chat with my friend Elyse today. She used to date Warren. She dated him for six months. She used to bake him spirit cookies before every game. She bought a four hundred dollar dress for a dance he failed to show up for.,6277
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,Okay and your point is?,6278
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Abby,"According to Elyse, Warren had one other significant failure as a boyfriend. Let's just say that he has a soft spot for the ladies in a very unfortunate location.",6279

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,I guess not.,6283
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"You had her pratically begging for you. Listen, Dawson, for future reference, getting lucky comes down to a simple Beatles/Stones question.",6284
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,What?,6285
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Do you want to hold her hand or do you want to spend the night with her? Many women say they're looking for a Beatle, but trust me, they're looking for something a little more tangible.",6286
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Ah, thanks.I'll keep that in mind.",6287
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,"You know what guys, maybe we should get out of here.",6288
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Ah, you know, it's funny watching you with this girl. So it makes sense the way you blew it with Jenny.",6289
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"I don't get you. You came into town to break me and Jen up. Mission accomplished. Are you pouting now, because some things didn't go according to plan.",6290
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,What?,6291
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"You don't think I don't know that you wanted me to get lucky tonight. So you can go whisper in Jen's ear, convince her that all men are dogs and assume that she'd seek your comfort.",6292
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"For all that wisdom, you sure bit hard",6293
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Hard enough to know that it's not my style. Man, it's yours. In fact, your style is pathetic. You know, if you really had Jen's best interest at heart, you'd stay away from her.",6294
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,Do you know these are the exact same words her dad used when he told me he sent her away? Do you think it's funny that you sound like her dad? I do.,6295
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,It's better than sounding like her loser ex boyfriend.,6296
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Billy,"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way, Dawson. And since you two cool guys probably wouldn't want a loser like me hanging around,I tell you what, have a fun time home boys.",6297

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Oh, my heart bleeds for you.",6304
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"Look, I know you're not the girl for me but ah, here's an idea. One way to get rid of a lie is to make it the truth. So maybe you and me",6305
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"You know, I'm afraid I'd be getting myself worked up for something that is quite the anti-climax.",6306
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,What?,6307
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"You're a loser, Warren. And frankly, you've been banned.",6308
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,So what is this? Some sort of sophomore threat?,6309
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"No. Just a reminder that if one person says something, it's a rumor, two people, well, it's gospel. But you're probably not planning on dating anyone ever again, so..",6310
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,Alright. What do you want?,6311
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,Complete and utter denial.,6312
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Warren,"Fine. Just so you know, the reason I picked you up this morning was, I thought it would be nice. You know, just.Saturday night, I have plans but they're breakable. What do you say? In public, official, groping optional, date?",6313
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"Yeah. Sure, uh, yeah. Ah, just pick me up after my limbotomy.",6314

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Dawson,"Nothing happened. I just walked her to her car. That's it. Nothing happened, alright? Trust me.",6321
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Pacey,"So you're just wearing that lipstick for a fashion statement, right?",6322

Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"(noticing the flavor of the ice cream that Joey has brought over) Yumm, cookie dough. (pauses) So, so what do you think, Joey, is there any way we can keep Dawson from coming in between us?",6332
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,Yeah..sure. He's only in love with one of us.,6333
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"You're right. (pauses) must be, oh, a lot easier than being the object of his infactuation. (pauses)",6334
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Jen,"Although I doubt after today, either of us will be vying for his affections.",6335
Dawson's Creek,1,8,Joey,"I know what you mean. I mean, just picturing Dawson, just so male, it's just. I don't know. It's made me nausous all day. (pauses thinking about what she's just said) You think he's already?",6336

Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Dawson, you are aware that she broke up with you, right?",6356

Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Dawson lays down on his bed next to Joey.),6358
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Look, Dawson. You don't sound like a guy who's disappointed in Jen's break-up etiquette. You sound like a guy who can't face the reality that it's over. Joey gets up from the bed and stands in front of Dawson.  You know, not to sound harsh but you can't live in the past. You have to start preparing for life after Jen.",6359
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Joey leans over and Dawson sits up.),6360
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Something tells me Joey has a theory.,6361
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,Okay. There are three main ideas to focus on.  First-public perception.,6362
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Such as?,6363
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Well, from now until the end of the semester, you'll be known as the guy Jen dropped. Most girls will view you as tainted goods and of course, there will be the few who'll feel incredibly sorry for you and offer a certain kind of sympathy. My advice-",6364
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,avoid them.,6365
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,That's easy enough. What's next?,6366
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,Other guys.,6367
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Other guys?,6368
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Look, Dawson, you have to be prepared for the possibility that Jen will begin dating again and seeing her around school with her new boyfriend, watching her from this very window as she pauses coyly at her garden gate, accepts a good night kiss from a guy you feel is physically and intelligently superior to in every way and you can't possibly..",6369
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Okay, Joey. I...um...get the premise. What's the third thing?",6370
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,You and Jen,6371
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Me and Jen?,6372
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Yeah. The inevitable conversation, which frankly, I'm surprised you haven't had yet. You know, she'll ask if you think the two of you can be friends again, because she'd really like that if you could and you say?",6373
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Joey looks at Dawson who isn't really paying attention to her anymore.),6374
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Come on, Dawson. You have to have an answer. You say?",6375
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"I don't know. I want to be her friend.  But then again, I don't. I mean, how could you simply be friends with someone when every time you look at them, all you think about is how much more you really want them.",6376
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Dawson stands up and looks at Joey. This time it's Joey who's a little distant.),6377
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Well, you know, I'm no expert at this, Dawson....but I think it can be done.",6378
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(The Leery house. Mitch is sitting at the kitchen table reading the newspaper and drinking a cup of coffee.  Gail is standing next to the counter drinking her coffee. The phone rings and Mitch picks up the cordless.),6379
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mitch,"Hello?... Yeah, hold on. She's right here. (He puts his hand over the receiver and signals to Gail.)  Gail?",6380
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Gail walks over and takes the phone from Mitch.),6381
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Gail,"Hello. This is Gail... You know, this is probably not a good time... Yes. Why don't we talk about this in the office?...Yes... Okay... Good-bye.  (She hangs up.)",6382
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mitch,Was that Calvin? I wish I had known. I haven't talked to him in a long time.,6383
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Gail,"No, it wasn't Calvin.",6384
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mitch,No? The voice sounded familiar. Who was it?,6385
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Gail,It was work related. It isn't what you think of us.,6386
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mitch,He has the nerve to call here?,6387
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Gail,He had a simple question.,6388
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mitch,"Oh. Well, you can tell Bob that the next time he calls here, the next time he interrupts my breakfast to call my wife, that the only simple question he'll need an answer for is 'do you have health insurance?'",6389
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Gail,It doesn't mean anything. You don't have to be angry with him.,6390
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mitch,That's wonderful. No greater way to start the day than hearing my wife defend an innocent motivation of her former lover. You know what Gail? You're right. I'm angry. It just doesn't happen to be at Bob. (Mitch leaves the room.),6391
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Gail,Mitch? Mitch? Mitchell!,6392
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Cut to Capeside High. Dawson comes down the stairs and walks by the lockers.  Jen sees him and stops to talk to him.),6393
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,Dawson?,6394
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Hi...Jen.,6395
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,Hi.  How are you doing?,6396
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Great. Great. You?,6397
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,"Great. Uh, Dawson. Uh. Look I know...I know that, uh, sometimes after a breakup, well, there's that awkward period where, you know, where two people who used to have so much to say to each other suddenly find their conversations reduced to the merest of small talk.",6398
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"So, what are you saying?",6399
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,"I'm saying what somebody always says. And what somebody else never wants to hear. But...But you think it's possible in some inconceivable way we could still be friends, Dawson?",6400
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Cut to the Biology class.  Dawson and Pacey are seated at a lab table before class begins.),6401
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,So she asked you to be her friend. What did you say?,6402
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"I didn't say anything, really. I just kind of stared at her then I told her I needed time to think about it.",6403
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"That's okay, Dawson. You still got some work to do here but I think we can salvage this.",6404
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,What are you talking about?,6405
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Well, uh, just between you and me. There is no way of hope you simply want to be Jen's friend. You're  still carrying around this huge torch for her that has no hope of extinguishing itself anytime too soon. Correct?",6406
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Yeah.,6407
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"The last person who needs to know about this external flame is Jen. What serves your purpose here is to let her know that you're completely over her, okay? It's yesterday's news, that's the quickest way to the ultimate goal of getting Jen back.",6408
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,How do I do that?,6409
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Mary Beth walks over to them.),6410
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,"Hey, Dawson.",6411
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Hey, Mary Beth.",6412
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,"So, I hear we're getting out midterms back today.",6413
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Yeah? Can't wait.,6414
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Mary Beth leaves to sit down.),6415
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Now. Upgrading Jen to girlfriend status. It's really a two part attack. The first thing you got to do is let her know that you're completely cool with the idea of being her friend. Okay? The quicker you can fake some sort of indifference, the less special she's going to feel. And the less special she feels, the more she's going to crave that very special feeling that comes from being Dawson Leery's girlfriend. Okay. A feeling that's not included in the friends package.",6416
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(The bell rings to begin class.),6417
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"So, What's the second thing?",6418
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Slow down, my friend. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.",6419
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,"(Dr. Ram, the biology teacher enters the room.)",6420
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dr. Ram,"Okay. The rumor is true. You will be getting your midterm exams back today. Good news is, most of you did very well. Before I hand them back, I'd like to see the following people after class. Those people are...(he flips through the test papers in his hand)...Pacey Witter. Well, I guess that's it.",6421
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Cut to after class.  Pacey is still at his lab desk looking over his test while Mr. Ram is standing at the front of the classroom.),6422
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dr. Ram,"Look, Pacey. I know you're a bright kid. You know what I did the first thing after I finished grading your exam?",6423
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,Stopped laughing?,6424
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dr. Ram,"I went to the guidance office and looked at your standardized test scores. You have an aptitude for this stuff,",6425
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dr. Ram,"Pacey. So when a student who's really bright makes a 32 on a midterm, you know who's fault that is?",6426
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,Yours?,6427
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dr. Ram,"Of course not. It's entirely yours.  Look, maybe Marine Biology is not your thing. Alright. Fine.  I'm not offended but I'm going to make you an offer that I highly recommend you accept. I want you to complete an extra credit project for me. Show me you understand everything we're learning here and I'll pass you. By the skin of your teeth.",6428
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,Yeah? Sure. What do I have to do?,6429
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dr. Ram,"Well, first, wait for a student from my sixth period class to arrive.",6430
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,Great. Another rocket scientist I presume?,6431
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dr. Ram,And then I'm going to assign a project that the two of you will work on after school and on free periods.,6432
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Hi, Dr. Ram. (Joey sees Pacey in the room.) Oh. Um, I can come back if you need some time.",6433
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dr. Ram,"No, No, you're right on schedule. Joey, I'd like you to meet your new lab partner.",6434
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,Him?,6435
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Her? Dr. Ram, I'd like to log a formal protest.  You never told me I was going to be working with a repressed control freak.",6436
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Yeah, and you never said my grade was dependent on helping some remedial underachiever.",6437
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dr. Ram,Well. Wonderful. I see no introductions are necessary.,6438
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Jen is at her locker when Dawson comes up to her.),6439
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Jen? Hi.,6440
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,Hi.,6441
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Um, I'm a little embarrassed. You asked me a very simple question earlier and I really should have given you a very simple answer. Jen, I would love to be your friend.",6442
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,Really?,6443
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Absolutely. And to ease any of your remaining doubts, I'll prove it to you.",6444
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,Okay.,6445
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Okay. So, let's have a friendly conversation, how was your day?",6446
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,Not too bad. Yourself?,6447
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Excellent. Any exciting plans for the upcoming weekend?,6448
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,"Look, Dawson. You know your friendship means a lot to me but maybe this isn't such a great idea.",6449
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Come on. We're friends now, okay? Whatever it is, I think I can take it.",6450
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,"Okay. Okay, well then, in the name of friendship, however misguided, I have a date with Cliff this weekend.  Uh, we're going to the carnival on Saturday.",6451
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Is that what you didn't want to tell me? (He laughs.),6452
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Quite frankly, I'm relieved.",6453
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,You're relieved?,6454
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,The truth is I also have a date this weekend. And we're going to the carnival. Isn't that a coincidence?,6455
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,"Yeah, it is. You know, if you want us to go someplace else, we can easily change our plans.",6456
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,We shouldn't run away from these things. We should look at them as opportunities.,6457
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,Opportunities for what?,6458
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Um, a double date.",6459
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,Are you serious?,6460
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Of course I'm serious. What do you say? The four of us?,6461
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,"Well I say, it's a little unexpected...um, but, hey if you're cool with it.",6462
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Completely. Yeah.,6463
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,Okay. Great.,6464
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Yeah.,6465
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,"(Dawson walks away, hurt.  The bell rings for the next class to begin.)",6466
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Cut to the cafeteria where Dawson and Pacey are getting their lunches.),6467
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"It's really not all that bad, Dawson.  Remember how I told you about getting Jen back is a two step process?",6468
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Yeah?,6469
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,Well this is the second part.,6470
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,What? Humiliate myself at a amusement park?,6471
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"No, man, dating other women. This is your chance to have Jen see you in action with other girls.  Now, I admit, going on a double date with your ex is an kind of an advance move. However, if it works out, this could be exactly the thing you're looking for.",6472
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,There's just one thing.,6473
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,What's that?,6474
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,My companion for Saturday is at this point fiction.,6475
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"That's really not a problem. I admit, it's kind of short notice but there are a lot of young ladies who'd gave up their very uneventful plans for a date with Dawson Leery. Huh?",6476
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Yeah.,6477
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Besides, I think I have the perfect candidate right there.",6478
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,"(Pacey gestures toward Mary Beth who is sitting alone, reading a book.  Dawson picks up his lunch tray and walks over to her.)",6479
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Mary Beth?,6480
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,"(looking up from her book) Oh, hi, Dawson.",6481
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Mind if I join you?,6482
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,"Oh no, be my guest.",6483
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Dawson sets his tray down and sits down next to her.),6484
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Look, maybe this is short notice and if it is, then I apologize, but I was wondering if you wanted to, sort of go out with me on Saturday?",6485
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,Saturday? Like a date?,6486
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Yeah, of course. Is there something wrong?",6487
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,"No. Yeah. Well, yeah. it's just that, uh, I know that you just broke up with Jen. And well, I don't know the particulars of it all, I do know that it's a common mistake made by many people to begin to date before they're really ready.",6488
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,I'm ready. Completely ready. I could not be more ready.,6489
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,Honest?,6490
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Honest.,6491
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Cut to the biology class.  Pacey and Joey are looking into an aquarium filled with snails.),6492
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Boy, this is fascinating.",6493
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"I'm sorry there are no cartoons to make this interesting for you, Pacey. But it's not designed to be fascinating. It's designed to be educational.",6494
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Thank you, Dr. Swissler. You know, refresh my memory of why we're here again.",6495
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"We're observing the reproductive process of palominos snails. And Dr. Ram said that they reproduce more when they're happy so by varying the contents of the t*nk, we can determine which factors are most conducive to reproduction.",6496
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Well, why didn't you just say that? We'll buy them a couple of drinks, turn off the light and come back in a couple of days.",6497
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"You never fail to disappoint me, Pacey. I mean, why did I actually think the very real prospects of repeating Marine Biology next summer might cause you to take this project seriously.",6498
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"You mean, summer school? It will never happen. Only morons go to summer school.",6499
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Yeah, well the last time I checked, your grade is still an F minus. So, about this extra credit project,  Pacey. I'm very well certain that your grade will not only place you squarely along with the morons but you may very well be there with them.",6500
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Cut to Dawson's room.  Dawson is at his desk looking at something under a magnifying glass.  Mitch knocks on the door and enters.),6501
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mitch,Hey.,6502
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Hey.,6503
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mitch,"Sorry to interrupt but I was just wondering if uh, anyone had called that I should know about.",6504
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Uh, no.",6505
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mitch,What about yesterday? Any calls?,6506
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Come on. I always leave the messages or on the answering machine.,6507
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mitch,"Forgive me, Dawson, but maybe I'm not being clear. I didn't ask if anyone had called for me personally.  I asked you if anyone had called that I should know about.",6508
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,No. He didn't call.,6509
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mitch,"Oh well, then. Thank you, Dawson.",6510
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(The next day.  Joey and Pacey are in the biology classroom checking out the snails.  Pacey has hands in the t*nk as Joey watches with an upset expression on her face.),6511
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Pacey, it was your responsibility last night to check on these snails and now look at them. They're dead.  Their shells are completely empty.",6512
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,I know. I'm sorry. I really am.,6513
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"It's ridiculous. Yesterday, we had a science project and today, we have what? Two thirds of a charm bracelet? Look, I'm just going to tell Dr. Ram that this experiment within an experiment just isn't working out.",6514
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Hey, before you go running off to Dr. Ram, there is an explanation. There is. Alright, you know how you said this experiment was all about seeing what environment was best for these snails? Right?  So, I did come in last night and I was watching the snails and watching the snails and there's nothing happening. So, I added some food, and I added some water and there still was nothing happening.  So I thought maybe the problem wasn't the environment, maybe these snails just didn't like each other. Right? Maybe they needed to be loosen up a little.",6515
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,I told you yesterday that palominos snails are  single sexed. They don't need anther organism to reproduce.,6516
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Right and I would have remembered that if I actually listened when you talked. But, I just thought that maybe snails are just like guys. You know, their ultimate fantasy is to be with two female snails at the same time.  Maybe that was what was needed to get this project rolling.",6517
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"So, let me get this straight. You tried to create some kind of snail ménage-à-trois.",6518
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Well, it sounds kind of stupid when you say it out loud but I just saw this really pretty snail in the t*nk over by the window and I don't know, but last night it just seemed really brilliant.",6519
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Let me fill you in on something here. You know, this pretty little snail over here by the window is what you call a carnivorous snail. You know what carnivorous snails eat?",6520
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,Other snails.,6521
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,Yeah. Other snails. Other snails such as our snails which are the snails we are desperately relying on to raise our marine biology grades.,6522
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Okay. I'm sorry. Okay? I know how important this project was for you. For us. Okay? Whatever I need to do,  okay, however I can make this up to you, Joey.",6523
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,"(Dawson and Joey are walking from the creek to her house, carrying nets.)",6524
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"I'm disappointed in you, Dawson. I mean, it's obvious that you're just using Mary Beth to make Jen jealous.",6525
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,I know. You think I don't know that Joey? I'm filled with the guilt of the worst kind. The kind that prays upon an innocent young girl who has a crush on you and you convince to go out with you for my own personal gain.,6526
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Well, if you know that, then don't do it.  Just call her up and say you have to stay in to wash your hair or something.",6527
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"I can't, Joey. It's just I know the person I thought I was could have some consideration for Mary Beth's feelings and cancel the date but I don't know. I just. I don't feel like myself lately. You know? Anyway, Pacey said that I should look at this as an opportunity.",6528
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,Wait a second. You're taking romantic advice  from a guy who spent his evening trying to get three snails to sleep with each other?,6529
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,When you put it that way..,6530
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Look Dawson, your little departure into jerkism is understandable, perhaps. but it isn't something  you should be proud of. Just promise you won't make a habit of it?",6531
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Jo, I promise.",6532
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Because, despite current evidence to the contrary, you're one of the good ones, Dawson. The other side is populated enough.",6533
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"You know, all things considered, I really wish I was taking you with me today.",6534
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Well, all things considered, I kind of wish you were too.",6535
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Pacey pulls up in his truck.),6536
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"(leaning out of truck's the window) Come on, Joey, let's get a move on.",6537
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"I see, my deviant lab partner has arrived. Pacey's graciously volunteered to transport me to the tidal pool so we can find a suitable replacement snails. See ya. (She gets into Pacey's truck.)",6538
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Dawson is waiting at the front entrance of the carnival.  Mary Beth walks up to him and greets him.),6539
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,Dawson.,6540
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Mary Beth, Hi.",6541
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,Hi.  So it is too forward if I tell you that you look really nice?,6542
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"No, it's not. Thanks. So do you.",6543
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,"Oh, no. You shouldn't feel obligated to say that. I mean...uh, I mean. I'm...ah. Let's just start over again. Hi, I'm Mary Beth.",6544
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Dawson.,6545
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Cliff,"Perfect. Looks like we're just in time for introductions,",6546
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Cliff,huh?,6547
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Yeah. Mary Beth, this is Jen Lindley and Cliff, her date.",6548
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,"Hi, it's nice to meet you.",6549
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,"Uh, same here, I think. Um, Dawson, a word, please?",6550
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Uh, we'll catch up.",6551
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Dawson and Mary Beth walk away from Jen and Cliff),6552
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,"This wasn't a freak coincidence, was it?",6553
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,A word? No.,6554
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,"Look, maybe on our planet taking an ex-girlfriend on a double date is a good idea but where I come from, it's not. In fact, it's a lousy idea. Especially when you fail to inform your evening's companion.",6555
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Look, it's not what you think.",6556
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,"Before you tell me what you think, let me tell you. It's pretty obvious you're still hung up on her",6557
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Mary Beth,6558
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,Please know that I'm often not wrong about these things.,6559
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Until now.,6560
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,Humor me.,6561
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Here's the absolute truth.,6562
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Pacey and Joey are rowing down the creek),6563
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,I've often regarded patrolling for snails as one of the more under-rated ways to spend one's evening.,6564
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"You know, despite what you might think, it's not my first choice of spending my Saturday afternoon, either. But, then again, I wasn't the one who tried to turn an aquarium into a playhouse retreat, now was I?",6565
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"You know, actually Joey, I'm really curious about something. I thought you were this great student, so uh, what happened to you on this midterm, huh?",6566
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,What do you mean what happened?,6567
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,What grade did you get? Was it a massive failure like mine or was it one of those near misses? I'm dying to know.,6568
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"You know, we're almost there and we don't have a lot of time so let's just save the chit chat for later, OK?",6569
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Stage directions,(Mary Beth and Dawson are still having their Œword.'),6570
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,"So, you're really doing this for Jen?",6571
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Exactly,6572
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,"Ah, it's one of her first dates with Cliff. She probably doesn't want to be alone with him so he doesn't really know if she likes him. So, in order to take the pressure off, she asks you to make it a double. God, Dawson, that is really very sweet of you.",6573
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Really, don't mention it.",6574
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,I can imagine some of those guys even trying to sabotage their ex girlfriend's date.,6575
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Really? That's terrible.,6576
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Mary Beth,"Yeah, I know. So, anyway, what should we do now?",6577

Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"Alright, Pacey, the water's getting pretty high, so we should probably... (she looks down to see their rowboat drifting away) Pacey!",6581
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,What?,6582
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,Please tell me you tied our boat up and the one floating downstream is not ours.,6583

Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Okay. I assume there's a suitable explanation for that story, Jo.",6682
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Joey,"No explanation. Look around you, Pacey. Look at what my life is. I'm a boarder in my sister's house. I share my bedroom with the living room and my social life consists of a part time job. As far as I can tell, there are only two ways to make my life better. The one that doesn't involve waking up and discovering it's all been a dream involves a college scholarship. And when I apply, I better have the grades to not give them a choice because a scholarship is pretty much my only way out of Capeside. If I don't get out of here, Pacey, well, it would be a sadder story than I can imagine.",6683
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Not to worry, Jo. You'll make it out of here. You'll go to a great school and send me postcards back here. I'll be tending bar or pumping gas.",6684

Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,What's that supposed to mean?,6703
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,"It means you shouldn't be here. I don't know why you wanted to come or why I let you but at this point in time, I really don't think that a seamless transition to friendship is in the cards for us, Dawson.",6704
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Well, I'm not sure you'd have the time for me anyhow. What? With your dating schedule and all.",6705

Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,Yeah,6708
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Is that what I'm doing? You know, because that's not my intent. My intent, since we suddenly have the time for, is for one small clarification.",6709
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,What's that?,6710
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Okay. When you broke up with me, one of the many questions I asked was why? Remember that? And do you remember your response? Your very convincing, very heartfelt response? You needed to be alone. There were too many men in your life and that you needed some time away from those men.",6711

Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"Okay. Why didn't you just tell me the truth? Why didn't you just say what only now, much to my dismay and embarrassment, beginning to realize. That you weren't tired of men. You were simply just tired of me.",6715
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Jen,"(softly) That is not true, Dawson. Alright. That is not true.",6716

(Dawson pauses) All of the oblivious cliques about the ex boyfriend who's still hung up on his ex, who doesn't want to say good-bye, who can't let go. Why did you allow me to come? Could it be? Could it possibly be that your reason is the same as mine? That you need me just as much as I need you? (Dawson looks at Jen who looks like she's about to cry) Jen?",6720

Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,Permission?,6733
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Pacey,"Yeah. You know that Joey and I have never really particularly liked each other. Right? That's why it seemed like a bad idea when we got stuck together on that Marine Bio thing. Funny thing is, it wasn't.  In some ways, and somewhere in there, I not only stopped disliking her so much, I began to sort of like her. As a friend.",6734
Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"At first, At first, I realized your feelings for Joey are somehow firm beyond the friendship stage.",6735

Dawson's Creek,1,9,Dawson,"You're my friend. And Joey's my friend. I don't care if who she kisses. And if it's you, so much the better. My two best friends, kissing, what could be better than that?",6743
