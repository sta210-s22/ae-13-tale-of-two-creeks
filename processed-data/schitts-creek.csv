Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"Gravel these days, what are you gonna do?",293
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"Yeah, it's gravel.",294
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Roland,"Yeah, it's gravel!",295
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Roland,"Hey, good news for you.",296
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Roland,I talked to a guy about that bathroom window.,297
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Roland,That's the least of my concerns right now!,298
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Roland,"Oh really? Well, why don't we address your concerns?!",299
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Roland,The doors! I want my doors back!,300
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Roland,Oh!,301
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,Before it gets dark!,302
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,My son is afraid of moths.,303
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"Oh, hmm. Well, here's the thing about that Johnny, you see, you did a bad thing.",304
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,You disrespected me in front of your family!,305
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,And now they think less of me.,306
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,I doubt that's possible.,307
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"And to be honest, you were kinda breathing down our necks a little bit back at the motel.",308
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"Johnny, when I was a kid and I did a bad thing, my father took the doors off my room.",309
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"And he said to me, ""Roland, privacy is earned.""",310
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,I am having a tough time following that.,311
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,What the hell does that have to do with privacy?,312
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"Nothing. I just got mad, and I took your doors.",313
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"Look, if you took offense to anything I said back at the motel, just know it wasn't personal.",314
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"All right, apology accepted.",315
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"Well, that was less of an apology, and more of an explanation.",316
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"Nevertheless, I accept your apology.",317
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,Which it wasn't!,318
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,So thank you again for that apology.,319
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"Well, there was no apology, and I can't do this anymore!",320
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"You said you're sorry in a very sweet and humble way, and that takes a big man to do that, and that's what Johnny Rose is! A big man! Ooh!",321
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,Oh! (Banging),322
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,Hello! Hello!,323
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,"Hi, hello, come here, please.",324
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,I don't suppose you saw any hobos or crackheads loitering around the hotel today?,325
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,"No crackheads, no...",326
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,"While the rooms were exposed to the world like a Moroccan fair, someone got in here and stole my earrings.",327
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,But it was just... but it was just you here today.,328
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,It was.,329
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,It was.,330
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,I'm assuming you were the only one here on the premises today?,331
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,I think I know where you're going with this.,332
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,"No, I'm simply confirming that you alone were here when the earrings were stolen.",333
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,Are you asking me if I stole your earrings?,334
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,"No, I would never, please!",335
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,But I also would certainly never press charges if my earrings were suddenly to be returned.,336
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,"If they suddenly reappeared, if you gave them back I would not press charges, I would look the other way.",337
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,"Okay, you know what? I gotta run.",338
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,'Cause I wanna hit the pawn shop before it closes.,339
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,"I owe my crack dealer a ton of money, so.",340
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,"You seem like you have this under control, though.",341
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,What just happened?!,342
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,"David, I politely asked that concierge girl if she had stolen my earrings, and she turned ice cold, and now she's on her way to a pawn shop!",343
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,What?! I need a towel!,344
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,"Hello, hi.",345
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,"Hi, I am sorry if my mom accused you of taking something.",346
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,It's fine.,347
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,"Okay, but does this mean that when you're cleaning our rooms, you're gonna put weird stuff in our beds out of spite, or something?",348
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,I won't be cleaning your room.,349
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,"Okay, can I ask you a question?",350
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,sh**t.,351
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,I think you're kind of rude!,352
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,Is that a question?,353
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,"I have asked you thrice now for a towel, so that I may wash this town off my body.",354
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,Do you think I wanna be here?,355
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,Do you think I wanna be here?!,356
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,"I don't know what you want, you've given me one word answers since I got here!",357
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,So if I get you a towel you'll stop following me to my car?,358
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,Yes! Yes!,359
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,"Fine, but I'm only doing this because you called me rude, and I take that as a compliment.",360
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,The man is a lunatic!,361
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,What the hell happened here?,362
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,We've been robbed.,363
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Stevie,Right now some local is pawning my earrings for crank.,364
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,Your diamonds?!,365
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,"Yes, my diamonds, the one thing I could hide under my tongue.",366
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,"Moira, I took your earrings out of here, and I put them in my shoe. For safekeeping.",367
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,No! No! (Anguished sob),368
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,Stavros just texted me.,369
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,"And he ended it, he's not coming!",370
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,"He said he doesn't have time to come and get me, because he already rsvp'd to Diddy's white party, and doesn't have time to do both!",371
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,But I was supposed to be his date to the white party!,372
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,"Alexis, he was never my favourite Stavros.",373
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,I've hated that guy ever since he asked me to do lines with him at my sixtieth.,374
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,"Just out of sheer curiosity, um, where do you stand now on whether or not you think this motel is cute?",375
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,"Like, is it still cute, or is it...",376
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,"You're a dick, David!",377
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,"Oh, I'm a dick!",378
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,"Okay, did I dump you for a party?!",379
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"David, help me with the doors.",380
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,"No I can't, I just got out of the shower.",381
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,I need help with the doors.,382
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,Oh my God!,383
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,"David, help him with the doors!",384
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,You help him with the doors!,385
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,No!,386
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,"David, could you help me with the doors?!",387
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,It's air drying!,388
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,"Pick up a hammer, and nail this coffin shut!",389
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,As if I didn't see this coming.,390
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,He's broken up with me five times already.,391
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,"Like, there was that time that he never met me in Rio,",392
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,and remember that time that he gave me his ex wife's engagement ring?,393
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,"And then, last summer, that time that he left his Molly in my glove compartment, and then I got arrested?",394
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,Oh my God! Can you do me a huge favour?,395
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,"And never repeat this to anyone that you respect, okay?",396
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,Okay? Okay.,397
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,Okay.,398
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,"Kids, we just came in to say good night, and to remind you that we will get through this...",399
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,"Okay, good night!",400
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,As a family...,401
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,Warmest regards to you both.,402
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,And that will end up on our feet in no time!,403
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,"Of course, by then our feet will be shoeless, and filthy and mangled, from walking on cigarette butts and broken beer bottles.",404
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,"So, seriously Alexis, enough about Stavros!",405
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,I'm sorry if I am going through something right now!,406
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,You're going through something?!,407
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,"Good night, children.",408
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Johnny,Good night!,409
Schitt's Creek,1,1,David,Good night.,410
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Alexis,(Tearfully) Good night.,411
Schitt's Creek,1,1,Moira,Let's all pray we don't wake up.,412
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Yep.,413
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,We make good choices.,414
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Mm-hmm, this was a really healthy choice.",415
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Well, I'm gonna go to work now.",416
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Okay.,417
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Which is where I should've been fifteen minutes ago.,418
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Mm-hmm.,419
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Stevie?,420
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Oh, Stevie!",421
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Stage directions,(Door slams),422
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,What?,423
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"It's your dad, he saw me! (Bleep)!",424
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"It's the towels again, we need towels!",425
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Your dad can't know about this!,426
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Stage directions,(Johnny knocks) It's humiliating for me!,427
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Stevie, is this where you keep the towels?",428
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"If it is, I'd love a key!",429
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Okay!,430
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Here you go.,431
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Okay, this is a face cloth, and a bath mat.",432

Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,I will get you some towels and I will bring them to your room.,434

Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no!",436
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,I will deliver them to your room.,437
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Stevie!,438
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Is everything okay?,439
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Yes, I'm just a little tied up right now.",440
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Stage directions,(Whispers) - Is anyone in there?,441
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,What? No!,442
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Are you in danger? Blink if you're in danger.,443
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Stevie!,444
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,That's really not necessary.,445
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Okay well, I'm going back to my room now...",446
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Stage directions,(Whispers) And I'm gonna call the police!,447
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"No, Mr. Rose, please don't call the police!",448
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Dad, please just take the towels, and go!",449
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Oh...,450
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Well, I uh, I've got everything I need...",451
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Good seeing you both.,452

Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,You slept with Stevie!,457
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"What, did dad tell the whole motel?!",458
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Well no, but I heard through the wall,",459
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,'cause he was doing his high pitched voice.,460
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"So, was it cute for you, or what?",461
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"It was fine, it was weird, it was weird, it was good.",462
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Love that.,463
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,It was good but weird.,464
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,I love that!,465
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Um, okay, so I have to tell you this, um, Ted wants to meet my friends, So I think it's getting kinda serious.",466
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,It's been two weeks.,467
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,I know.,468
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"What's your point, David?!",469
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Ugh! So anyway, We're throwing a party at his place tonight, so I would say be there around like, seven.",470
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"That's presumptuous, what if I have plans?",471
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"That's so cute, bring Stevie!",472
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"No, I'm not bringing Stevie, it's not a good time, I'm gonna let the dust settle on that...",473
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Well okay, but Ted's already getting groceries, and I may... I already invited her.",474
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,So it's gonna be fun!,475
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"David, it's gonna be so much fun!",476
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Children, children!",477
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Your father and I have something to discuss.,478
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"I'm really busy right now, though.",479
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"I can't right now, I don't have time.",480
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"We understand you have found some local friends with whom to spend ""time"" with Oh my God!",481
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Okay, I can't deal with this right now-",482
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,And that's fine.,483
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,But we do have to be careful with our hearts and our parts.,484
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Because a podunk baby out of wedlock is not something your father and I can afford to negotiate at this moment.,485
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Well, that's crazy, because all I want to negotiate right now is some podunk baby out of wedlock! So-",486
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Okay, hi. Hi!",487
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"I don't wanna sound negative about this at all, but I think that you two really actually need to consider the idea of um... Getting a life.",488
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Alexis, I would not concern yourself with your mother and me, because we have a flourishing social life here.",489
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Walking over to the cafe and ordering a tuna melt is hardly what I would call a flourishing social life.,490
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Oh, that's funny. That's funny.",491
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Yeah, it's just that you're so involved in our lives right now, and that was fine when we were child actors for a little bit, but now David and I are grown up adults, and we're just feeling very like, um...",492
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Suffocated.,493
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Suffocated.,494
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Suffocated?!,495
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Wait, stop, stop!",496
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,We came in here to speak about you two!,497
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,What could you possibly have to say now?,498
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Well, now I don't remember.",499
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Yeah, I don't remember.",500
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Oh my God! Thanks.,501
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Stage directions,"(Birds chirp, distant traffic rumble)",502
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"You know, the more I think about it, the more I wonder whether David's whole... ""Sexually adventurous"" thing was just a phase.",503
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,It's not a phase.,504
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Well, you know, he was very influenced in college, all those haircuts.",505
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"It's not a phase, John!",506
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"The kids are right, we've been talking about them far more than I care to do.",507
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Something about that top that just knocks me out, baby!",508
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Hey, how you doing?",509
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Ah, okay...",510
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Jocelyn, hi!",511
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Hi, Moira.",512
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Why don't you join us?,513
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Moira, what're you doing?",514
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Attempting to be social, support me.",515
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Won't you, please?",516
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Hey, sure! Hi!",517
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Of course.,518

Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Look at us, all being together!",524
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Yes...,525
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Jonathan and I were just saying, wouldn't it be fun to have the mayor and his wife over for cocktails and charades tonight!",526
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Yes... Tonight.,527
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Oh, yeah, no, unfortunately that's not gonna work for us.",528
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,We're having a huge party tonight at our place.,529
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Ton of people coming to our house. Whoo!,530
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Oh yeah, big!",531
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"But we're free any other night, other than tonight.",532

Schitt's Creek,1,10,Stage directions,"(Bell thumps, clanks)",534
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Hey.,535
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"So, um...",536
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"So the other... so, last night um...",537
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,That was just a...,538
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Was a one time thing.,539
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,That was a one time Like a blip.,540
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Just a blip... Just a blip blop. Just a...,541
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Stage directions,(Inhales sharply),542
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,My sister said that she uh...,543
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Invited me to Ted's, yeah.",544
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Yes, she'd asked you to Ted's.",545
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Yeah.,546
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Yep, um...",547
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Okay, well I'm gonna leave from here, should I just come by your place, and get you when I'm done?",548
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Yeah, we can go together, 'cause that's...",549
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"That's like, a totally normal thing for us to do.",550
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Why would it not be?,551
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"No, it's not! I mean...",552
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,So um...,553
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"So, cool!",554
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Yeah, no, this is a good thing.",555
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,So I'll just um...,556
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"I'll see you when you swing by, so...",557
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Yeah, I'll be- okay, all right, blippity blop. Blippity blip.",558
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Stage directions,(Alexis groans),559
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,You're quiet today.,560
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Am I?,561
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"It's just that you're not talking, and it's annoying, because I'm bored.",562
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Can't we just think and work, or do we always have to talk?",563
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Okay, you're being super sketchy and emo right now, what is going on?",564
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,Have you ever been in a relationship where you find yourself cheating Yes!,565
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,With someone in your dreams?,566
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Oh, what?",567
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Oh. Um... you know that if it's in your dreams, or over the clothes, it's not cheating, right?",568
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Yeah well, it's been happening a lot lately, and then I look over and I see Twyla, and I feel bad.",569
Schitt's Creek,1,10,Moira,"Also, Ted is throwing a party tonight, maybe that's something exciting for you two to do together?",570
